<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>That “one touch of Nature which makes the whole
World kin” is surely nowhere more obvious than in
the “Courtship” of Animals. For the “Beasts that
Perish,” no less than Man himself, are stirred by the same
emotions; the Fever of Love runs as high in them as in
ourselves; and its modes of expression are not so different,
though they may superficially appear to be so. The nature
of these differences and their interpretation, it is the
purpose of this book to set forth.</p>

<p>Charles Darwin laid the foundation for the study of
this phase of Animal behaviour in his masterly work on
the “Descent of Man,” a work which has been much
criticized and much misunderstood since Carlyle’s crude
abuse of it as the “Gospel of Dirt.” Darwin was the
first to show us that the fierce battles, and strange antics,
which characterize so many of the “Lower Orders of
Creation” under the exaltation of the Sexual emotions
are manifestations fraught with tremendous consequences
to the race.</p>

<p>The facts which he brought to light, and the discussions
to which they have given rise, have, however, unfortunately
been too commonly regarded as merely interesting to
those who have a liking for Natural History.</p>

<p>This is a most unfortunate mistake. For such facts
have a vitally important bearing on the very problems
of social well-being which now loom so largely among us.
“Reform” is in the air. Its protagonists are busy<span class="pagenum">x</span>
amongst us with schemes for our regeneration, among
which “Sex-problems” are made to occupy a very conspicuous
place. But no good can come of their cogitations
so long as they fail to realize the springs of behaviour
in this regard. The facts herein set down will, it is hoped,
help much towards this end.</p>

<p>My labours in the preparation of these pages have been
materially lightened by the help and counsel of many
friends. To them I desire now to record my very grateful
thanks. More especially am I indebted to my friends
Mr. H. Eliot Howard, Professor Lloyd Morgan and Mr.
John Cooke.</p>

<p>I must also thank those who have contributed towards
the illustrations which enliven these pages. The delightful
Frontispiece, and many of the plates scattered through
this work, I owe to the generosity of Messrs. Rowland
Ward, Limited. The excellent rendering of the Birds of
Paradise adapted in part from the work of Mr. G. E.
Lodge and the late J. G. Keulemans, and partly drawn
from specimens in the British Museum, is the work of
Mr. Roland Green. The very difficult, and less fascinating,
technical figures I owe to the skill of Mr. Philip Whelpley.
The wonderful photographs illustrating the “Display”
of the Sun-bittern and the Kagu were taken by my friend
Mr. D. Seth-Smith.</p>

<p>Finally I have to thank Mr. Roger Ingpen for the
immense amount of trouble which he has taken in seeing
these pages through the press.</p>

<p>The nature of life is generally regarded as affording a
theme which possesses no more than an academic interest:
but there is one aspect of this great subject which must
attract us all, and that is its power of reproducing itself.
Life begets Life, as Love is said to beget Love. The
nature of this mysterious power we can only dimly realize,
and the forces which underlie its manifestations few even
suspect, save perhaps in a vague way. Yet the tree of
Knowledge bears no fruit more vitally important to our
well-being, than that which will make us “as Gods,
knowing good and evil” in all that concerns the processes
of reproduction. But curiously enough, this is a forbidden
fruit, and those who eat thereof are expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>to maintain a discreet silence on the subject. These
enlightened ones, however, cannot remain altogether
dumb. But they speak, in the veiled language, of Art
and Poetry, Literature and the Drama. They talk
round the subject rather than of it. Love, Hate,
Jealousy, and Envy, are but attributes thereof. We
profess to believe that “Knowledge is Power” and
to desire to increase its force among us by raising the
standard of our system of education. But education
which does not, of set purpose, reveal the sources of
our being and of our emotions, good and evil, is no more
than a travesty of education; and they who seek to
foist upon the community Knowledge thus emasculated,
are unworthy to wield the power which has been placed
in their hands. If social well-being be the aim of the
high-priests of Education, then something more than
copybook maxims like “Be good and you will be happy”
must henceforth be preached. Of what avail is it to
exalt the name of Knowledge, while the straightest road
thereto is barred across and marked “No thoroughfare!”
These blind leaders of the blind seem to imagine that the
social well-being they profess to desire can only be attained
by side roads, leading anywhere, save in the direction of
this Pool of Siloam.</p>

<p>The stuff of which living things are made is called
“Protoplasm.” Text-books of Physiology give its
chemical constituents with fearsome accuracy, and each
of these constituents can be isolated in the laboratory,
but “all the king’s horses and all the king’s men” cannot
build these up again into living matter. Its consistent
inconsistency defies us; every statement we make of it
has to be qualified by reservations and saving clauses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>Its permanency is attested by the fact that it has endured
through millions of years, yet we are daily reminded of
its evanescent nature. Its power of reproducing itself
according to type, none can doubt, yet no two individuals
are exactly alike.</p>

<p>The purely physical phenomena of life, to be rightly
appreciated, must always be considered in relation to the
psychical phenomena which are the soul of life. These
subtle and intangible forces cannot be experimented with
in the laboratory, or expressed in formulæ; we cannot
denote their strength in horse-power. Just as the physical
manifestations of life begin with lowly types, so
the psychical begin, and they gather strength and
complexity with the bodies they pervade. These manifestations
we call behaviour, and in their more intense
developments, “emotions.”</p>

<p>These emotions present an infinite range of variety in
the higher animals, and they attain their maximum of
intensity wherever the reproductive activities are concerned.
The part which these activities play in controlling
behaviour is by no means always apparent, and
is commonly not even suspected. Even man himself is
subject to this control. And it is this fact which lifts the
“Courtship” of the lower animals out of the category
of merely curious phenomena. For the springs of his
conduct, his behaviour and “emotions” under varying
circumstances, can only be understood, and even then but
imperfectly, by comparison with other creatures lower in
the scale, so far, of course, as comparison is possible.</p>

<p>This line of inquiry, then, takes one back to the simplest
living things, among which there is neither marrying nor
giving in marriage, neither birth nor death. Life is reduced
to its simplest terms—a speck of animated jelly is
all that confronts one, and this is only to be seen under a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>high power of the microscope. It has neither mouth nor
organs of digestion, no visible means of locomotion are
traceable, and the special senses of sight and hearing are
wanting; but taste and smell, of a nebulous kind, are
there. Shape it cannot be said to have, for its bodily
outline is constantly changing, thereby it moves. A
long tongue of its jelly-like substance, or “protoplasm”
as it is called, is thrust forwards, and the rest of the body
is, as it were, dragged after it. Whatever animal, or
vegetable, matter it passes over, in the course of its
wanderings, is drawn up into the semi-fluid substance of this
diaphanous body, and its juices extracted, the undigestible
residue is left behind in the course of the morning’s
walk! In due time it becomes adult; further growth
is impossible. When this stage is attained a strange thing
happens. A certain minute, more solid portion of this
body, which lies in the very centre of the mass and is
known as the “nucleus,” begins to assume an hour-glass
shape. Speedily the constriction becomes apparent
across the whole body and rapidly increasing, cuts it in
two, as if by the tightening of some invisible thread.
Here Death is cheated, and records of births are unknown!
And just as there are no parents so there are no children.
But a foreshadowing of what is to be occurs even here.
For every now and then two individuals, to all appearances
identical, meet and promptly begin to merge the
one into the other till they twain become one flesh in very
truth. Here is the most primitive form of marriage in
Nature. And here, in this union, or fusion, of separate
entities of Germ-plasm, we have the beginning of sex.
Such unions are common among these primeval forms
of life. In many cases this “marriage” takes place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>between two particles of Protoplasm of which one is
rather larger than the other. In such case the smaller
is regarded as male, the larger as female. Here we have
the first sign of “sexual differentiation” or the evolution
of “male” and “female” individuals.</p>

<p>Some such union, some such process of “rejuvenation”
by the importation of “fresh blood” seems to be imperative
for the continuance of existence throughout the
whole animal world, even though it may take place at
rare intervals of time. Why should this be? Is this
strange meeting and commingling a matter of chance, or
is the one seeking the other possessed by a ravenous
mate-hunger?</p>

<p>As we ascend higher in the scale it becomes apparent
that life has gathered force. That primitive speck of
jelly, the Amœba, with which we started, gave but two
signs of animation—the power of movement, and hunger.
Whether these responses to internal stimuli can be called
instinctive is open to argument. But there can be no
question about the instinctive nature of the behaviour of
these higher animals. After the instinct to feed the
two most powerful are the desire for self-preservation—the
avoidance of danger—and the desire to mate. These
two are the dominating instincts throughout the rest of
the animal world, not even excepting man himself.</p>

<p>The tremendous power of “mate-hunger” has been
overlooked by a strange confusion between cause and
effect. Almost universally its sequel, the production of
offspring, has been regarded as the dominant instinct in the
higher animals. This view has no foundation in fact.
“Desire” for the sake of the pleasure it affords, and not
its consequences, is the only hold on life which any race
possesses. And this is true both in the case of man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>himself and of the beasts that perish. Wherever this
instinct becomes weak, or defective, extinction speedily
and inevitably follows. This “Amorousness” is the
motive power of “Courtship” wherever it is met with;
manifesting itself in the eccentric, and often grotesque
posturings, or in the loud and often musical cries which
constitute the study of courtship. Intensity of desire is
indispensable to survival.</p>

<p>Only the lowly and sedentary types, of which the
Oyster may be taken as an example, lack this fire; and
here because it is unnecessary. For the reproductive
germs of this animal are discharged into the water, to
take their chance of attaining their object. They are
liberated unconsciously, discharged like the undigested
residue of the food, without effort, and without cognizance
of the act. This must be so, for the Oyster merely lives—vegetates.
Sightless, and without power of movement,
after its larval wanderings are over, it lives merely to eat.
And even in this, choice is denied it. The currents of
water mechanically brought to afford the necessary
oxygen for the maintenance of life, bring with them the
food which is to restore the slowly wasting tissues. To
such a creature there can be no “outer-world,” no consciousness
of the existence of individuality other than
its own.</p>

<p>The desire for sexual intercourse is met with only where
the co-operation of two individuals is necessary to ensure
the production of offspring. Such individuals being free
to roam, must have some incentive to seek one another
at the time when their germ-cells have attained maturity.
And this incentive is furnished by the glands in which
these elements are produced: supplemented by the secretions
of certain ancillary glands. These stimulating juices,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>known as the “Hormones,” will be presently described.</p>

<p>But if we owe our existence to the gratification of
what may be called our lower instincts, it is no less certain
that all that is best in us we owe to our offspring. We
meet with the beginnings of altruism, which the begetting
of offspring entails, far down in the animal kingdom,
and it attains to its full perfection in the human race.
Here only, in its best and truest sense, Love begins:
though affection may be found, and in a high degree,
in many of the lower animals.</p>

<p>Living things are as clay in the hands of the potter.
But it is as if they made themselves, for the designer and
the guiding hand are alike invisible. No vessel is exactly
like its neighbour, either in the quality of its substance
or in the details of its construction. And this because
the clay of which it is made possesses that mysterious
property we call life. A property which endows each
new feature as it appears, with an individuality of its
own, whose survival, or suppression, depends entirely
on its relationship to surrounding parts; on its harmony
with its environment, in short. Colour, size, shape,
temperament, behaviour, may each be regarded as so
many entities depending for survival on whether or
not they can exist in harmony with their environment—the
several parts which make up what we call the
individual.</p>

<p>In like manner the individual—the complex bundle
of parts and qualities—must attain, and maintain, a
certain harmony with its environment—the outer world.
The process of change, both in quality and quantity,
which is for ever going on among the several parts of
every separate individual, brings about the elimination
of unfavourable variations; and “selects” those which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>vary in the right direction: that is to say, which serve
to maintain a place in the sun for the individual in which
these momentous changes are going on. But it is not
enough that the individual should be in “working order”;
it must be in harmony with all the conditions on which
existence depends. And the standard of this harmony
is set by that very exacting arbiter of life and death,
“Natural Selection.” It is not enough that the instincts
in regard to this or that habit should be keen, or that this
or that particular organ of the body should be efficient—a
certain minimum, all-round, standard of efficiency
is demanded, or elimination follows. It is through this
instability of “temperament,” this tendency to vary
in infinite directions, that the balance between the
individual and the environment is maintained. Evolution
follows the line of least resistance.</p>

<p>The little boy who remarked that it must be “fiddling
work, making flies,” was more sage than he knew. The
complex web of factors which even a fly represents are
beyond the grasp of human understanding. But it is
clear that the reproductive instincts, and the emotions
they beget, have played, and play, a tremendous part
in the evolution of the higher animals.</p>

<p>Those whose business it is, for one reason or another, to
study these emotions know well that “mate-hunger” may
be as ravenous as food-hunger, and that, exceptions apart,
it is immensely more insistent in the males than in the
females. But for this, reproduction in many species could
not take place: for the sexes often live far apart, and
mates are only to be won after desperate conflict with
powerful rivals no less inflamed. Thus it is idle to speak
of an equality between the sexes in this matter, in regard
to the human race. Dogmatism, and the frequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>repetition of pretty platitudes, will not alter what Nature
has ordained. The failure to realize this is painfully
obvious in the utterances of many who speak in the name
of the newly-founded “Eugenics” society, which seeks
the means to ensure the well-being of the race by
the spread of a more intimate knowledge of this all-important
subject. The existence of what Mr. Heape
has recently called a “sex-antagonism” is beyond
dispute, for the instincts of the male and female are
fundamentally different. The male is dominated by the
desire to gratify the sexual appetite; in the female this
is counteracted by the stimulation of other instincts
concerned with the cares of offspring.</p>

<p>Amorousness, then, is the dominant feature of the males
among all animals: and this sex presents yet another
characteristic which is to be borne in mind. In all that
concerns the evolution of ornamental characters the male
leads. In him we can trace the trend which evolution
is taking; the female and young afford us the measure
of the advance along the new line which has been taken.
Why this should be is inexplicable. But sooner or later
the females assume, or will assume, all the features
originally possessed by their lords; and finally the young
also follow suit. That is to say, the females and young
tend to retain the ancestral characters. In the course of
time the ability to develop new features by the male
loses its impetus, and not till then, apparently, do the
females, and still later, the young, begin to share his
glory. These remarkable features are strikingly illustrated
among the birds, as these pages will show.</p>

<p>Nature is nothing, if not perverse. And hence it
happens that there are many exceptions to every rule
which one formulates. Among the birds, for example,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>there are species wherein the rule that the female
follows her mate in the acquisition of new characters
is, so to speak, set aside. She follows a line of her own.
This is true, at any rate, of superficial characters,
such as coloration. By some curious change in her
“metabolism,” as the conversion into living tissue of the
substances taken as food is called, this coloration may
attain a brilliance in no way inferior to that of the male,
but strikingly different. The beautiful Orange Fruit-pigeon
(<i>Chrysoenas victor</i>) furnishes a case in point, the
male being of a gorgeous orange-yellow, the female of
a no less vivid green. But the differences are not so
great as they appear at first sight. For the male was
originally green, and the female has thus but intensified
the ancestral livery. Green, it should be remarked, of
a more or less olive shade, always precedes yellow in
development; and yellow may yield to red, but this order
is never reversed. A no less striking case is that of the
Upland Goose (<i>Cloephaga magellanica</i>), the male of which
is pure white, while the female wears a livery of chestnut
and brown. But so sharply are the colours defined
that it would be difficult to say that one was of a higher
order of coloration than the other. To what causes or
factors are these departures due?</p>

<p>Reproduction in the simplest living things takes place
by a simple division of the body into two as soon as its
maximum size or adult condition has been attained.
In such simple types the body consists only of a single
“blob,” or particle, of jelly. But a new era began when
large numbers of such particles, or “cells,” began to
form coherent masses, different parts of the mass performing
different work for the mutual benefit of the
community. Some have come to form what we call the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>body, which is born, and in due course dies. Others are
alone concerned with the task of reproduction. They are
nourished by the body, and on attaining maturity, give
rise to new bodies. These reproductive cells are excessively
small. The male, or “sperm” cell, can only be
distinguished under the highest powers of the microscope.
The female cell, or “Ovum,” is always larger than the
male, because, in addition to the germinal matter which
it contains, it is furnished with a store of food in the
shape of yolk. This accounts for the relatively enormous
size of the egg of the hen. Within the hardened shell
the germ develops into the chick, deriving food for its
growth from this generous store. Where this yolk is
limited in quantity the growing body is hastily fashioned,
and launched forth into the world in the form of a “larva,”
when it must forage for itself till it has attained its adult
form. Or it is retained within the body of the mother
until development is complete.</p>

<p>The reproductive cells are the bearers of the Germ-plasm,
the stuff of which man and the beasts of the field
alike are fashioned. Only a portion of this germ-plasm
gives rise to a new body; the rest is, as it were, held
over and stored within the new body to give rise to
another in due course. That which produces the body we
call the “Somatoplasm,” because it is the “plasm” or
stuff of which the “Soma,” or body, is made. As to
the nature of this Germ-plasm and its mysterious
properties, a wide divergency of opinion exists among
<i>savants</i>. But the views which find most favour to-day
are those of the veteran Professor August Weissmann, as
set forth in his work on the “Germ-Plasm, a Theory
of Heredity.”</p>

<p>The excessively minute quantity of this germ-plasm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>which suffices to form a new body is incredible. By what
miracle of miracles is the essence of a man distilled? His
body arises from the union or commingling of two particles
of living matter so minute as to be invisible to the naked
eye. One of these particles is the “sperm”—cell furnished
by the male parent; the other, the “ovum,” furnished by
the mother. True the ovum may measure as much as
the one-hundred and fiftieth part of an inch, but the
bulk of this is yolk-food necessary to furnish the tender
germ with life and energy till it shall have attached itself
to the walls of the womb, whence all its future nourishment
is derived.</p>

<p>By no process of analysis known to us could the germ-plasm
of man be distinguished from that of, say, a jelly-fish;
and in the matter of quantity there is no more
difference. Yet, identical to our senses, in potentiality
how amazingly different are these two particles of jelly!
In the lowliest animals, such as jelly-fish, one cannot
distinguish male and female at sight. The appearance
of separate male and female individuals begins somewhat
high in the scale marking an epoch in the history of
animal life. For the birth of sex inaugurated not merely
individuals producing distinctive “male” and “female”
germs, but individuals which, by virtue of their sex,
developed differences of behaviour and mentality which
were to be followed by tremendous consequences. Certain
aspects of this behaviour are to furnish the theme of
these pages; others, and no less important, those who
will may discover in Professor Arthur Thomson’s
“Evolution of Sex.”</p>

<p>We are far, indeed, from being able to explain the
attributes of sex. At most, we can but endeavour to
interpret the behaviour associated therewith. This was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>the task which Darwin set himself to achieve in his theory
of sexual selection. He was influenced in the train of
thought which he followed up with such brilliant success
by what he had observed in the behaviour of highly-ornamented
species, such as the Peacock and the Birds
of Paradise. The strange antics of these birds when under
the influence of sexual excitement persuaded him that
they were at least dimly conscious of their splendour, and
of its power to fascinate. The female, on the other hand,
was supposed to be coy, and to bestow her person on the
finest performer. In this way the dullest birds and the
poorest performers were gradually eliminated. Here,
indeed, was sexual selection. The frills thus begotten he
called “Secondary Sexual Characters,” a term which is
also used, and was used, by him, to include any feature
whereby the sexes can be distinguished apart from the
character of the genital organs.</p>

<p>Horns, tusks, and spurs are other forms of secondary
sexual characters. And these stand for another form of
sexual selection—that of selection by battle. Herein
victory falls to the strongest and most pugnacious male
who, as the spoils of victory, annexes the females which
formed the subject of the duel. This theory, which must
be discussed at greater length in the course of these pages,
has had many critics, and among them men of mark. But
whatever modifications may be deemed necessary, they
will be such as are demanded by the results of later discoveries
rather than to the force and subtlety of the
arguments of his opponents.</p>

<p>One of the most formidable of the opponents of the
Sexual Selection theory was Wallace. But his arguments
were far from convincing, and often inconsistent. He
attributed the more frequent occurrence in male animals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>of brilliant coloration and exaggerations of growth such
as give rise to manes, beards, long plumes, and so on, to
a “surplus of strength, vitality and growth-power which
is able to expend itself in this way without injury,” or, as
he sometimes expresses it, to superabundant vitality. He
was evidently striving to find words for the faith that was
in him, and he was nearer the truth than he knew or than
his critics supposed. He was seeking facts which only
the physiologist could furnish. And these made their
appearance long years after with Professor Starling’s
discovery of Hormones. We are far from understanding
the origin of these mysterious juices which must be so
frequently alluded to in these pages, but they are evidently
intimately associated with the expenditure of energy.
This may sometimes find an outlet in increased stature,
sometimes in pure luxuries of growth. The force of
Wallace’s arguments was crushed out by the weight of
detail they were made to bear.</p>

<p>Mr. J. T. Cunningham a few years ago entered the lists
and failed to achieve his purpose no less completely.
His was a theory which assumed too much. In the first
place it was based on the transmissibility of acquired
characters, of the truth of which there is at present no
evidence.</p>

<p>He contends, for example, that the vivid hues of scarlet,
blue, yellow and violet which colour the naked skin of
the neck of the cassowaries and of both sexes, and the
curious horny casque which surmounts the head, are
the outcome of the constant laceration of the skin inflicted
by the males during their conflicts for the possession of
the females. He assumes that such conflicts take place,
and he assumes that such “acquired characters” are
transmitted. Now, as a matter of fact, these birds do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>not fight with their beaks, but with their feet. And to
this end the claw of the inner toe is enlarged to form a
great spur. But there is no evidence that the skin of
the neck is ever damaged in such conflicts as they may
engage in. No scars are ever found, at any rate, to lend
support to this theory. The casque, which is similarly
supposed to be a mark of honourable conflict, is an “ornament”
of great frailty, for it is composed of a delicate
filigree-work of bone covered with a thin sheath of horn.
In like manner, the long plumes which surmount the
heads of birds like the Peacock, and many Birds of
Paradise, and the wattle which surmounts the beak of
the Turkey, are supposed to have had their origin in
similar pugilistic encounters in the past. Mr. Cunningham
is surely pushing the theory of the transmission of
acquired characters a little far. For what has been
transmitted in these cases is not a number of scarred
surfaces, but a series of hypertrophied structures. An
amazing array of ornamental characters, symmetrically
disposed, and often vividly coloured, in short, has been
produced from lacerated tissues which in kind and extent
can have varied but little.</p>

<p>Evidence has been accumulating during the last few
years which would have rejoiced the heart of Darwin. Had
he known that birds of sober hues “display” with the
same animation and with as much elaboration of posture
as the Peacock and the Pheasant, his theory of “Sexual
Selection “would probably have left little for those
who came after him to criticize. Since his time it has
been discovered that both permanent and recurrent
secondary sexual characters, such as the antlers of deer
and the temporary nuptial plumage of birds, such as the
Ruff for example, are controlled as to their growth by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>the stimulating action of the “secretions or juices formed
by certain of the ductless glands “; that is to say,
of glands having no apparent connection with their
surrounding tissues. We owe much of our knowledge of
this subject to Professor Starling, who has called these
secretions “Hormones.”</p>

<p>Darwin knew that the essential sexual glands, the testes
and the ovaries, in some mysterious way controlled, in
a large degree, the development of these “hall-marks”
of sex, for it was known in his time that castrated stags
failed to produce antlers, and that hen pheasants, for
example, in extreme old age, or when the ovaries were
damaged by disease or injury, at once assumed the
plumage of the cock; but the part played by these
ductless glands was quite unsuspected. They are the
Thyroid, and the Thymus glands, which are attached
to the outer walls of the trachea or windpipe. The
Pituitary body, which forms part of the brain, and the
Suprarenal bodies, attached to the kidneys. It would
be foreign to the purpose of these pages to enter into the
functions of these glands; suffice it to say, that the
juices formed therein are taken up by the blood, and
distributed over the system. Their action is only very
imperfectly understood. We know that any derangement
in their efficiency results in disease, and that they
play a very important part in the reproductive system,
as will become abundantly evident in the course of
these pages. Much hitherto attributed to the action of
“Sexual Selection” alone, it is now evident is largely due
to their action.</p>

<p>The all-sufficiency of the “Sexual Selection” theory
to account for the development of armature, such as
horns, antlers, and the huge spine-like outgrowths
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>which form so conspicuous a feature of many of the
extinct Land-dragons, or Dinosaurs, has been by no
means universally accepted. Some authorities like Dr. A.
Smith Woodward and Professor Osborne interpret these
after another fashion. They hold that these are the
“expression points” of inherent growth forces, a
process of concentration marking the final stages of
evolution prior to extinction. From which it may be
inferred that there is a term to the life of a species as
there is to the life of the individual. In many cases
it is suggested the very exuberance of growth has been
the exterminating factor, as in the case of the huge
antlers of the Irish “elk,” whose enormous weapons
hampered his endeavours to escape his enemies. This
is the theory of “Orthogenesis,” or direct development.
According to this, new structures, arising in the germ-plasm
as “variations,” will of their own inherent vitality
go on increasing in each generation unless, and until,
checked by “Natural Selection.” Changes in the
character of the “Hormones” might very well bring
about these excesses of growth. It is well known that
the exuberance of growth which produces giants
among the human race is due to a derangement of the
secretions or hormones of the pituitary body which
largely control growth.</p>

<p>Another factor of Sexual Selection which is commonly
ignored, but which is of profound importance, is to be
found in the part played by the emotions in regard to
sexual relationships; the part which the “mind” has
played, and plays, in the mating of animals, at any rate
of the higher types.</p>

<p>Darwin touched but lightly on this theme. Later
writers have almost entirely ignored it. Almost all that
is worth knowing on the subject we owe to Professor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>Lloyd Morgan, who was one of the first to take up
this difficult line of investigation, and to Professor
Groos. Their researches have shown that there can
be no doubt but that the emotions have played and are
playing an important part in the phenomena we are
striving to analyse. Sexual selection, in short, is concerned
not merely with the evolution of the physical
characters of the body, but also, and no less, with
the psychological attributes thereof. Many new and
extremely valuable facts in this regard have been brought
to light by Mr. H. Eliot Howard in the course of his
remarkable studies on our native warblers. Not until
the psychology of sex in the lower orders of creation has
been further investigated shall we have a properly
balanced account of the part played by sexual selection
in the scheme of evolution.</p>

<p>By now it will have become apparent that the study
of the “Courtship” of animals is one of alluring interest
and full of pitfalls for the unwary. And this because of
the apparent difficulty in drawing any hard-and-fast line
between the part played by “Natural” and the part
played by “Sexual” Selection, at any rate in some cases.</p>

<p>To this aspect of the theme Professor Lloyd Morgan
has drawn particular attention. “It is difficult,” he
remarks, to accept the view that individual choice
has played no part where the sexual instincts are concerned.
But supposing that it has played its part ... the
effects will be wrought into the congenital tissue of
the race if, and only if, there are certain individuals
which, through failure to elicit the pairing response,
die unmated. Is preferential mating, supposing it to
occur, carried to such a degree that some individuals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>fail to secure a mate? That is the question. If so,
sexual selection is a factor in race progress; if not, though
it may occur in nature, it is inoperative as a means of
evolutionary development. The whole question, in itself
a difficult one, is further complicated by the fact that
the males which are possessed of the most exuberant
vitality, and are therefore by hypothesis rendered the
most acceptable through emotional suggestion, are likely
to compete with other males of less exuberant vitality
by direct combat. Such competition, by which the
weakest are excluded from mating through no choice on
the part of the female, falls under the head of natural
selection, and not of sexual selection, if by that term we
understand preferential mating.</p>

<p>“This serves to bring out the difference ... between
natural selection through elimination and conscious
selection through choice.... Sexual selection by
preferential mating begins by selecting the most successful
in stimulating the pairing instinct.... The
process is determined by conscious choice. It is in and
through such choice that consciousness has been a factor
in evolution.”</p>

<p>Herein Lloyd Morgan, like Darwin, recognizes the
existence of a dual machinery in determining survival,
where this depends on the co-operation of two individuals
leading separate existences—Natural, and Sexual, Selection—sometimes
the one and sometimes the other
prevailing. In the former, the females are seized by
force; in the latter, won by displays.</p>

<p>But is this really so? In these pages it is contended
that a sharp line must be drawn between all those attributes
and characters which are necessary to achieve individual
survival, the survival of the Ego, and all those which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>on the other hand, are necessary to achieve reproduction
and the survival of the race. The former are governed,
or determined, by Natural, the latter by Sexual, Selection.</p>

<p>The sphere of influence of these two factors may be
delimited, if we regard natural selection as the factor
accountable only for the qualities necessary for the
survival of the individual—necessary to ensure success
in the struggle for existence. Then it will become
apparent that the qualities and attributes necessary to
achieve the survival of the <i>race</i> are of a different kind,
and these are the factors which are embraced under the
term “Sexual Selection.”</p>

<p>It is a mistake to regard animals in relation to the
selection theory as if they were so many tailors’ “mannikins.”
Yet a large number of the critics of the selection
theory seem to fall into this error, ignoring all but the
most superficial characters.</p>

<p>The peculiarities of colour, structure and behaviour, that
is to say, the characters and qualities which distinguish
the individuals of any given race, are due to inherent
qualities of the germ-plasm. Each of such qualities,
therefore, may be regarded as entities. Selection determines
their survival. Intracellular selection is the first
sieve through which they have to pass, natural and sexual
selection are others, as circumstances may determine.</p>

<p>As a rule the sex of an individual is attested by more
or less conspicuous external features. These are known
as the “Secondary Sexual Characters.” But no hard-and-fast
line can be established for these, at any rate, so far
as colour and ornament are concerned, for such, as will
become apparent in the course of these pages, tend to
appear first in the male, and then, later, to be acquired
by the female, until in many cases the two sexes become
again indistinguishable.</p>

<small><small>“MANKIND IN THE MAKING”</small></small></h2>

<p class="indent f08">The use of the term “Courtship”—Primitive Man and the
Foundations of Society—“Amorousness” as a motive force—Polygamy—Our
half human ancestors—Standards of Beauty—Disquieting
signs.</p>

<p>Our ideas on the subject of the “Courtship” of animals
are of necessity largely framed on what has been
observed by each of us in regard to our own race; and
without any very careful analysis of motives, or thought
of what lies behind. But no real insight into this most
tremendous subject can be gained which does not strive
to penetrate beyond what is actually seen; which does
not endeavour to get at the source of conduct in this
regard.</p>

<p>“Courtship” is the word we commonly employ to
describe the act of wooing; and in civilized human society
at any rate, the intensity of the emotions which inspire
the desire to woo are held in restraint by a variety of
causes—and hence the “Courtship.” In the lower
animals it is a moot point whether the term “Courtship”
can be accurately applied. They are governed by no
conventions, for them there is neither modesty nor
immodesty. Desire with them is not made to walk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>delicately, veiled according to custom; nor is it artificially
fostered as among civilized communities by stimulating
food and the crowding together of large numbers of both
sexes in artificial surroundings. Rather it is a natural,
rhythmical, highly emotional state, which gathering force
inhibits the ordinary emotions, or, rather, overrides them,
begetting an intensity of passion which brooks no control.
It demands, without parleying, or mincing matters,
what is really the object of courtship among the civilized
human communities—the consummation of the nuptial
ceremony. The term “Courtship” is a Euphemism.
Nevertheless, bearing this in mind, it may conveniently
be used in these pages.</p>

<p>We cannot hope to understand the springs of courtship
in the human race from what we observe in present-day
society, or even from what we have gleaned thereon from
the records of remote ages. We must get back, so far as
is possible, to the very dawn of the human race: to that
period of man’s evolution when his conduct was controlled
by purely savage instincts. But even then the
mark of the beast must have been fading out. His most
valuable asset, his larger brain, even then gave him an
advantage over the Apes, his near relations, and over
the beasts of the field which he had begun to bring into
subjection. We may assume that like his anthropoid
relations, he was of a solitary, nomadic disposition,
wandering in small parties from place to place as fancy
or food determined. His advance to this stage started
when, by the activity of his enlarging brain, he began to
be oppressed by the gloom of the forest, and drawn by the
fascination of more open country, and the ever-varying
scenes which exploration brought him. But this life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>begot new needs and new desires. Hitherto, hunger,
self-preservation and self-perpetuation were the only
stimulants which roused his activities; and they were also
the three forces, and powerful forces, which shaped his
love of solitude. The proximity of his fellows threatened
his three most vulnerable points—they competed for
his food, they endangered his life, and threatened the
possession of his family.</p>

<p>This more varied and adventurous existence roused
new centres of activity in his brain; he began to perceive,
though dimly, the possibilities of a larger life, though
doubtless one which would minister to his own comfort
rather than to that of his family—the natural and only
road to better things. He began to devise more expeditious
means of securing food, and circumventing his
enemies, among whom the most formidable was his
fellow-man, because in him he met his match. In the
course of his wanderings he had learned the use of stones
as weapons—which he could never have done in the
forests—and he had also discovered the value of his
family as ministers to his comfort, if only by setting
them to collect such food as did not require strength
and cunning in its capture. An inherent love of the
chase for the sake of the excitement which this afforded
probably made him nothing loth to regard hunting as his
own peculiar duty. A little later the advantages of
neighbourliness were borne in on him, largely for the sake
of the greater ease wherewith the animals of the chase
could be captured by their combined efforts; but this
begat comradeship and some of the graces which follow
therefrom.</p>

<p>Thus was laid the foundation of Society and “civilization”
with all its attendant barbarities. Then, as now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>whatever discordant notes were heard, were those struck
by the twin Demons Envy and Jealousy. These disturbers
of the peace are parasites on Society, their very
existence depends on it. They have played a larger part
in fashioning its rules and regulations than is generally
realized. Their influence is as powerful to-day as ever
in the past. It expresses itself in varying degrees in
different individuals, and is roused by varying causes.
But the most potent of all is jealousy in regard to sexual
matters.</p>

<p>Amorousness, a word with a deep meaning, was, and
is, the underlying factor which shaped, and is sustaining,
human society; and is no less powerful among the beasts
that perish. The motive force in this has not been the
desire for offspring, but for the satisfaction of the
elemental animal passion, the gratification of the purely
sexual emotions which at their height are irresistible.
There may be some who will see in this contention a
degrading aspect of life. But this view will obtain only
among those who prefer the man-made sophistries of life
to its Divine mysteries. This dominance of what are
popularly called the animal passions is the outcome of
a perfectly natural process, whereby those in which these
passions were defective died without offspring, while
those who tended to excess were similarly eliminated.
The desire for offspring for its own sake may exist
among our own species to-day but, normally, offspring
follows as an effect not as a cause. Many of our social
problems would straighten themselves out if these facts
were once faced and acknowledged; we are apt to concern
ourselves with what should be—according to our
ideals—rather than what is. Let it be granted that this
rendering is true, and much else that mystifies becomes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>clear.</p>

<p>Whether primitive man was monogamous or polygamous,
or whether he practised promiscuity, are themes which
have exercised the minds of the most ingenious since the
custom of making books began, and the most diverse
conclusions have been arrived at. In coming to any
conclusion on this subject probability based on what we
know of the higher apes can be the only standard of argument.
In these animals monogamy is the rule, the male
and female with their young roaming at large in a family
party. Occasionally, however, a male is seen accompanied
by two females, and this is only what we should
expect. The Apes are not very prolific animals nor
are they numerous in individuals, hence, should any male
be killed either in combat with a rival or by any other
means, his mate probably wanders in search of another
male, by whom, when found, she is probably readily
adopted even if he should be already mated.</p>

<p>In like manner lived our half-human progenitors. But
with them family parties no longer wandered aimlessly
searching for food, but with a purpose. No longer forest
dwellers, or vegetarians, food would require more zeal and
discrimination in collecting, and shelter of some kind had
probably to be devised, partly as a protection against
predatory animals, and partly for personal comfort, since
it would now have become apparent that this could be
appreciably increased by the exercise of a little effort
and ingenuity. This appreciation of creature comforts
formed a cement holding the family together; a sense of
safety in Society helped still further. Rude tools chipped
from flints were among their earliest and most cherished
possessions for the sake of the advantages they secured.
Here was the earliest form of wealth and the birth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>labour and a further step on the road to progress. Little
would now occur to derange the harmonious routine of
the daily life, save only the ever-present jealousy of the
head of the family which was assailable both from within
and without. His sons and daughters were probably
now regarded as a portion of his wealth, for they ministered
to his comfort, and aided in the daily work which had
now become a necessity. As his sons attained to maturity,
so they became rivals to be watched with a jealous eye,
and finally driven off, while his daughters at the same
time became potential mates. This danger of close inter-marriage
was a real one, though it cannot be supposed
that it was in any way realized. The risk was evaded
by perfectly natural means. The jealousy of the head
of the family which drove him to expel his sons as they
attained maturity provided the means. These young
bachelors sought their mates from neighbouring families,
and it is probable that they would not be hard to lure
from their parental control, but in such matters force
was able to effect where persuasion failed.</p>

<p>These mate hunting excursions are to be regarded as
extremely powerful factors in securing the betterment of
the race. They were adventures in which all must fail
who did not possess courage, cunning, and brawn, for,
paradoxical as it may seem, evolution depends, not so
much on the qualities of the individual as on the elimination
of the unfit. As yet might was right. But the
strife of combat, fierce and merciless, had its beneficial
results not only in weeding out the physically and
mentally deficient, but in stimulating affection between
the victor and his prize.</p>

<p>As the advantages of neighbourliness dawned upon these
children of nature, rules and regulations, for the control
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>of the individual on behalf of the good order of the community,
came into being; and among the earliest laws to be
framed, we may be certain, were those for the regulation
of marriage. These, as we may gather from the history
of savage races to-day, did not concern themselves with
chastity, at any rate before marriage, it was enough if
they secured the right of possession, and excluded the
dangers of close intermarriage. Promiscuity in the past
was never the practice of any race, its existence to-day,
among both savage and civilized people, is due
in part to imperfections in the social scheme, and in part
to the vagaries of individuals.</p>

<p>That the sexual instincts form the bed-rock on which
depends the survival of all races of animals, which, for
their propagation, require the co-operation of separate
sexes, is beyond dispute. And it is no less certain that
in so far as the evolution of man is concerned, jealousy
has been a powerful integrating factor.</p>

<p>Among the higher animals apart from Man, both polygamy
and polyandry are met with, and this with no
apparent detriment to the race. It is significant, however,
that polyandry is never met with among the
mammals, and but rarely among the birds, when, as will
be shown, this form of sexual relationship has been
accompanied by a profound modification of the behaviour
of the sexes in regard, not only to courtship, but to the
offspring. The male has lost his masculinity, and the
female her femininity. In human society both forms of
marriage prevail, and there can be no doubt, from the
history of such customs, that of the two types, polygamy
is much to be preferred. It is certain that no race which
practices polyandry can do more than hold its own, and
that in a low grade of development. This cannot be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>said of polygamy, which might indeed be commended
as a solution of some of our own social problems, were
it not almost certain that the remedy would prove as
bad as the disease.</p>

<p>The subject of “Courtship” in so far as it applies to
the human race is one concerning which little can be said.
Westermark, Letourneau, Sutherland, and last but by
no means least, Darwin, have brought together a mass of
facts bearing on the status of women among communities,
savage and civilized, ancient and modern, and from
these much may be inferred. To this harvest, however,
Darwin himself still remains the most important contributor
on all that directly concerns the “Sexual Selection”
theory. Other writers seem to have paid more attention
to the laws governing the possession of women than to the
discussion of the motives which may have controlled the
choice of mates. Instances of amatory dalliance, such
as are met with among the inferior apes, and the
birds, seem to be wanting. This negative evidence
seems to show that, even among the most ancient,
the most Ape-like, half-human races of man such
dalliance was unknown. And this because primitive
man, in his love-making as in everything else, was accustomed
to take what he wanted, or die in the attempt.
It is to this forcefulness of character that the
human race owes its progress throughout the ages.
But did he, when desire possessed him, exercise any
sort of choice, when this was possible? What were
his standards? These are unanswerable questions; at
most we can but infer what his behaviour may have been
from observations on existing races of mankind. These
seem to demonstrate that while some races profess admiration
for certain of their physical peculiarities, these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>cannot be attributed to the action of sexual selection.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the low, beetling brows,
protruding mouth, and flat, broad nose which characterized
the earliest human peoples, were slowly eliminated
by the æsthetic taste displayed by the females in
their choice of mates. Now in the first place, it is highly
improbable that they had any choice allowed them, and
if they had, these are just the characters which were
most marked in the males and might, or probably would,
in consequence, have been deemed “manly” and desirable,
for it is hardly to be supposed that such people would be
capable of conceiving ideas of a possible refinement of
their personal appearance if they could but add to the
height of their foreheads and reduce the size of their
faces. These graces settled down on them as the brain
enlarged and habits changed. But the process of transformation
must have been infinitely slow, and quite
imperceptible from one generation to another.</p>

<p>The absence of secondary sexual characters in man,
such as the brightly coloured areas which are so conspicuous
a feature of many of the lower apes, is to be
explained by his fundamentally different mode of life.
Such vivid hues obtain only in species which live in
troops, and they serve as aphrodisiacs, ensuring mating
to every female forming a part thereof, which would be
by no means certain were there no external signs of her
condition. Primitive man, like the higher apes, was
instinctively monogamous, and of necessity solitary, till
he had acquired a tolerable measure of self-control and
neighbourliness. When lust possessed him, he was
obliged, in making his maiden venture to scour the country
in the search for the object of his desire. This found,
and won, probably only after desperate conflict with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>head of the family, the nuptial ceremonies would be short.</p>

<p>The greater physical strength of the male and his higher
brain capacity are probably the result of Natural, rather
than of Sexual Selection. The former would weed out
all the weakly and dull-witted in the ordinary course of
the struggle for existence, the latter, during the early days
of man’s development, would award the prizes of life to
the most amorous and cunning, and to the most ambitious
of the competitors.</p>

<p>The secondary sexual characters of the female are
chiefly negative characters, the absence of those which
are conspicuous in the male. She retains more of the
primitive characters of the race. This is the rule in
regard to the animal kingdom. Wherever we desire
to find the onward tendency of evolution, the latest
developments of the race, we turn to the male; when we
desire to learn something of the past history of the species
we turn to the female and young. This standard, of course,
yields by no means uniform results, for we find every
gradation of progress on the part of the latter, till male
and female and young are externally indistinguishable.
But the order is almost invariably the same—first the
male, then the female, then the young. Thus progress is
more or less automatic or “Orthogenic,” as the scientific
text books have it, new characters, as they appear, tending
to go on increasing in amplitude till checked by Natural
selection. It is to be noted, however, that this transference
is limited, for the female never inherits characters
which are concerned with aggressiveness to the same
degree as in the males, as witness, for example, the brow-ridges
and huge canines in the case of the gorilla.</p>

<p>Darwin believed that the beards of men have developed
by the selective choice of the women who preferred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>bearded men, while the secondary sexual characters of
the women indicate the lines of male choice. There is,
however, no evidence to show that in the past—for these
characters are as old as man himself—woman had any
choice whatever in the choice of her mate, save under
exceptional circumstances. He was led to this conclusion
by one or two striking instances apparently demonstrating
this choice, and on these he seems to have based his version
of the influence of sexual selection in man. The first
of them is furnished by the Hottentots wherein, in both
sexes, there is a marked “Steatopygy,” or accumulation
of fat on the buttocks. In the female this is excessively
developed, and it is said that such females are
highly prized by the males. Darwin cites an instance of a
woman in which this accumulation was so enormous, that
she could only rise with the greatest difficulty from a
sitting position. But there is no evidence to show that
less favoured females remained unmarried.</p>

<p>In other tribes the breasts attain excessive proportions,
so much so that they can be slung over the shoulder
to feed the infant strapped to her back. These may
have been increased by sexual selection, the preference
of the males for such mates as possessed this feature in the
most marked degree; but there is good reason to believe
that such characters, which, it must be remembered, are
the outward manifestation of germinal variations, once
having appeared, would of themselves, of their own inherent
vitality, have gone on developing. They won
favour from long familiarity, which has imparted a
semblance of increment from choice. These increments
of growth in any given generation would be imperceptible,
but variations in excess of the average would be conspicuous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>and excite admiration from their very strangeness.</p>

<p>The part which sexual selection has played in determining
the physical characters of the human race has
without doubt been overestimated. Its influence may
be said to have ceased with the development of the
emotional side of his nature. This momentous process
began with the male and had its roots in the ebullitions
of his inherently amorous nature which has been the
dominating factor in his career, and will be to the end,
however much its influence may be disguised by the
complex conditions of civilization.</p>

<p>These emotions, varying in kind and intensity, are
such as are embraced in the term “Love” in the highest
sense. They control the selection of mates, but this
selection takes no account, save by accident, of qualities
which have any value as factors of race-survival. In
the lower animals these are determined by natural selection,
and sexual selection adopts as it were the material
furnished thereby. It “selects” only in so far as it
eliminates the non-sexually inclined, and those which
lack the qualities essential to ensure reproduction, such
as weapons for example. In human communities natural
selection is largely avoided, and “mate-hunger” seems
now to be swayed by more than the mere desire for its
satisfaction. With the development of human faculty
new factors have been introduced, complex emotions
have come into being, whose influences are as yet only
vaguely understood. Whither are they tending? What
will be their effect on race-progress? These are matters
of grave importance to us all, and to the student of
Eugenics in particular.</p>

<p>Of man’s higher emotions, which, it is contended, now
govern his conduct, probably the earliest to assert itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>was the æsthetic. His quickening mentality could not
fail to be captivated by the bright hues of birds and
butterflies, and flowers, the glorious colour-effects of dawn
and sunset, the seasons in their changes and so forth.
And as this sense of the beautiful slowly gathered force
he would seek to decorate his naked body with such
of the more brightly-coloured objects around him as were
suitable or rather with such as could be affixed thereto.</p>

<p>As a signal mark of his favour and affection, he would
occasionally transfer some one, or another, of his most
lasting ornaments to his mate, and the additional
charm this would give her ensured a continuance of such
gifts, and paved the way for tribal fashions. But then,
as now among savages, the males take the lead in this
matter of ornamentation, but in proportion as affection
grows, they are transferred from him to her, so that
among civilized races to-day, the custom is entirely
reversed, the women, not the men, wearing the finery.
So soon as families began to be neighbourly and to combine
for the sake of company and mutual help, the spirit
of rivalry, so essential to progress everywhere, would
tend to increase the number of such gifts, and to set
“fashions.” With the foundation of society “selection”—by
the elimination of the unsocial, would ensure,
not only the survival of such fashions, but their multiplication
and diversification, producing results which, to
our eyes, have often been hideous. The immediate
effect of this form of selection, however, was not a change
in physical characteristics, but in the evolution of personal
ornaments and development of the æsthetic sense.
Progress in this direction must have been infinitely slow,
and the lower races of to-day furnish us with instructive
object-lessons in its course. In many cases uglification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>rather than refinement has attended their efforts.</p>

<p>It is indeed more than probable that the various types
of ornamentation obtaining among savage races had their
origin in outbursts of sexual exaltation. One of the
earliest methods of personal decoration was probably to
daub the body with paint, as is the custom during the
performance of various religious and semi-religious rites
among the Australian aborigines. A desire to find
a permanent substitute for paint led to the practice
of cicatrization, and the later and more refined custom
of tattooing. But personal mutilation has taken many
and strange forms, such as knocking out the front teeth,
filing them to saw-like points, inserting gold or jewels,
or staining them. No less extraordinary are the various
types of lip and ear ornaments, and the suspension of
ornaments from the nose. The various fashions of
dressing the hair are also traceable to this origin.</p>

<p>That these modes of personal decoration designed for
special occasions should in course of time become permanent,
and should, in many cases, have lost their original
associations is but natural. To-day among savage and
barbaric races many of these modes of transfiguration
have become associated with religious and semi-religious
ceremonies, but many have been retained solely to enhance
the personal appearance, even though in our eyes an
exactly opposite effect has been attained. Among the
natives of the Congo, for instance, the face is covered with
raised patterns formed by cicatrization; that is to say, by
cuts made with a knife, which are made to form scars on
healing by means of pungent juices or heated iron. Further,
the teeth are filed to form saw-like cutting edges, producing
a revolting effect according to European ideals,
but charming according to the standards of those thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>patterns which adorn the tattooed face of the Maori present
a result more nearly pleasing. Many of the natives
of East Africa pierce the lobes of the ear and hang ornaments
therein so heavy, that in due course a hole large
enough to run the arm through results. These are
mutilations of a purely ornamental character. Curiously
enough, precisely similar forms of mutilation occur
among people dwelling in different continents, as in the
case of the lip and ear ornaments worn by natives of
Africa and South America. There can have been no
means of communication between these races, and hence
we must conclude they were independently derived.</p>

<p>More striking still is the practice of deforming the
head which prevailed among the Peruvians, the Caribs
of the West Indies, and the natives of Vancouver, and
the Chinook Indians, wherein it attained its maximum.
Among some tribes, the head was depressed from
above downwards, giving the skull a cone-shape, the
apex pointing backwards; among others the pressure
was applied to the back and front of the head, giving a
more or less globular shape, and causing the sides of the
head to bulge ominously. Now these distortions are
to be attributed solely to the whim of Fashion. But
how could this have arisen? No adult could have started
it, for the form of the skull cannot be altered once
its growth is completed. The conception of this diabolical
custom apparently then arose in the brain of
some fiendishly ingenious person, who realized that to
effect its realization pressure must be applied to the head
of the infant at its birth and for some considerable time
after, by squeezing the head between boards, or tying it
round with thongs of hide. That disastrous results would
follow from this tampering with the brain would seem an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>unavoidable conclusion; yet such was not the case.
During the moulding process, travellers who have witnessed
it tell us, children display no sign of suffering, even though
their eyes seemed to be starting from their sockets from
the pressure. But they cried when the thongs were
loosened. On attaining to man’s estate, such victims
to parental folly seemed to be in every way as intelligent
as the men of neighbouring tribes which had no such
insane customs.</p>

<p>How deeply rooted was the prejudice in favour of
this extraordinary fashion is shown by the fact that
when, during infancy, from sickness, or other cause, the
bandaging was neglected or omitted, and the child, in
consequence, attained to man’s estate with a head of
the shape designed by nature, he was seriously hampered
in the struggle for existence, for no honours among his
tribe were possible. Indeed, as often as not he was sold
as a slave. But thus did Public Opinion bring disaster
on its advocates, for those misguided people have been
swept off the face of the earth by their own folly. Those
who survived the ordeal, it is true, seemed in no way
mentally deficient, but the infant mortality must have
been great, and none of the adults could ever have attained
to their full potentiality.</p>

<p>These people were, however, not the only lunatics at
large. For this extraordinary practice found its devotees
in many other widely sundered parts of the world. Deformed
heads of various types have been found in rock-tombs
near Tiflis, in the Crimea, Hungary, Silesia, in South
Germany, Switzerland, and even in France, Belgium and
England! How did it spread from one nation to another?
Since means of communication were extremely limited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>centuries ago, one can only suppose that in most cases it
arose independently. It is possible that the idea started
with the unintentional deformations of the head which
follow the practice of carrying the child during early
infancy. It is well known that if a child be constantly
carried on one arm, so that one side of the head continuously
presses against the shoulder, a more or less marked
asymmetry of the skull results. It would be enough for
the head of one of the chief’s children to show a rather
unusually marked asymmetry of this kind for every mother
to endeavour to copy the defect, for imitation ever was
the sincerest form of flattery!</p>

<p>To place these superficial, non-transmissible, artificially
created features, such as deformed heads, mutilated
teeth and ears, and so on, in the same category as the
“secondary sexual characters” of the lower animals
which are physical, inherent and transmissible features,
is to ensure confusion of thought. The one represents
a physical, the other an emotional development. The persistence
of certain forms of mutilation esteemed beautiful
in human society is not to be attributed to Sexual selection,
or to “preferential mating,” for these things are
not only non-transmissible features, but outside the sway
of the amorous instincts, as is shown by the case of those
individuals who, living in a community where deformed
heads are <i>de rigueur</i>, have heads of normal shape. So
soon as such perversions become a part and parcel of everyday
life, they become essential to the general well-being
and comfort of their possessors, enabling them to follow
their normal avocations without exciting the dislike or
wounding the prejudices of their neighbours. The
absence of the “tribal sign” alienates the esteem and
comradeship of his neighbours and brings an unenviable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>notoriety. In like manner albinos among birds, for
example, are hunted down by their fellows and killed,
and birds of exotic species conspicuous by reason of their
unfamiliar appearance are treated in the same manner.
The sexual instincts have no part in this.</p>

<p>It will have become obvious in the course of this
chapter that Sexual selection as a factor in shaping the
evolution of the human race has not played a very conspicuous
part. Nevertheless, the balance of opinion to-day
is probably in favour of the view that the physical peculiarities
by which we distinguish one race from another
are, for the most part, due to the influence of this form of
selection. A more careful survey of the facts will
show that this view is untenable. And there is no more
striking demonstration thereof than that it has been
inconsequently applied to account for features in one
race, which in another are attributed to environment or
to Natural Selection. It may safely be asserted that
colour, the shape of the nose, the prominence of the jaws,
and the character of the hair, are no more the result of
“Sexual Selection” than stature, for example. These
are the manifestations of inherent growth forces, or
“tendencies,” which owe their survival, and development,
to the influence of Natural selection.</p>

<p>Sexual selection has brought about the dominance of
the male, by the struggle between males for mastery,
originally for females. It “selected” for survival, in
primitive races, those males with the thickest skulls
and the strongest physique; it determined the survival
of the keenest witted and most aggressive and most
amorous males, and it eliminated those in which the latter
features were too active. It assured victory, in short,
to those only who possessed just those qualities on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>which life or death depend in moments of conflict. In
the case of the females, it assured survival only to those
who possessed strongly developed maternal instincts and
submissiveness.</p>

<p>It is by no means realized that the incidence of moulding
forces has changed and is changing with the environment
of the race. So long as physical force, as between
man and man, determined survival, as among savage
races to-day, so long does it ensure to such races strong
men and strong children, for in conflict with neighbouring
tribes victory rests with the most powerful of physique
and endurance and the most prolific. This last is an all-important
concomitant if repeated conflicts are to be
successfully waged. Among civilized peoples such contests
began to lose their value in this regard when, by
the introduction of arms, physical personality became a
steadily diminishing factor. Victory now rests rather
with those peoples who are most skilful in devising engines
of destruction. The brain, not brawn, tells. But man
cannot live by brains alone. With the inevitable decline
in his physical nature man’s hold on existence is seriously
imperilled. Civilization is making for extinction as much
as over-specialization in the case of the lower animals.
Hitherto, save in the case of decaying nations, women
have played but a minor part in what we may call the
“tribal” affairs of the race. Among the civilized nations
of to-day, in proportion as the “maleness” of the
community becomes more and more effete, the victims
of sophistry, and the slaves of shibboleths, so the influence
of the females asserts itself. And recent events
among us show plainly enough that that influence is the
reverse of good. Having its roots in personal vanity,
and the love of notoriety, it is intolerant alike of reason
and self-restraint, and that way madness lies.</p>

<small><small>MAN’S COUSINS THE APES</small></small></h2>

<p class="indent f08">The Man-like Apes and their mode of Life—Their “Courtships”—Musical
Chimpanzees—How the Orang-utan improves his
voice—His likeness to Caliban—The truculent visage of the
Gorilla—“Ornament” in the lower Apes—The Concerts of
the Howler Monkeys.</p>

<p>We are none of us given to boasting of our poor relations,
and most of us indignantly repudiate our kinship
with the Apes. But facts are stubborn things: the
relationship is there, whether we admit it or not: and
those who love truth for truth’s sake will not shirk the
comparison between themselves and their remote cousins.
Unhappily, from our present point of view, this cannot
be carried very far, for the “Love idylls” of the Apes
have yet to be written. Such facts, however, as have
been gleaned are interesting. Of the higher, man-like, or
“Anthropoid” species only the most meagre information
is to be obtained; but this nevertheless is interesting.
For the most part we have to be satisfied with inferences
drawn from a study of the external differences between
the sexes—from the “Secondary Sexual Characters,”
in short, and from the records of travellers who have
encountered these creatures in their native wilds.</p>

<p>The species which throw most light on this theme are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>the Gorilla, the Chimpanzee and the Orang-utan. Of
these the Chimpanzee has most in common with the
human race. But it may satisfy the qualms of many
to know that between the Ape and the Man there is a
great gulf fixed. The brain of the largest Ape is less than
half the size of that even of the lowest of mankind. Man
is a reasoning, and for the most part a reasonable,
creature; he is a tool-making animal. This is more
than can be said of any of the apes, even the most
intelligent. Their teeth and immensely powerful arms
must serve their every need. No ape ever fashioned for
himself either a knife, a vessel to carry water, or any
means of transport; and herein we have a measure of his
brain capacity. The huge jaws and great canine teeth
are no less conspicuous “marks of the beast.”</p>

<p>These, however, man himself has but recently lost, as
was proved by the sensational discovery of the skull of an
ape-like man at Piltdown, in Sussex, during 1912. Herein
the jaw was essentially that of an ape, while the base of
the skull was as markedly human. The cheek teeth, or
molars, were of the human type; but the canine was
ape-like, though much inferior in point of size. That the
men of this remote age—which was possibly that of
Pliocene times and certainly not later than early
Pleistocene—had begun to use rudely-fashioned tools, is
proved by the roughly-chipped flints found with the
remains. With the invention of tools the decline in the
size of his “eye” teeth began.</p>

<p>In all the large apes these “eye” teeth are of great
size. Their purpose, it would seem, is primarily to serve
as weapons in conflicts between rivals. Such conflicts
are apparently unintentionally, and unavoidably, provoked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>by the loud cries uttered by the males in their
endeavours to discover the whereabouts of females
desiring mates. Of necessity roaming far in search of
food, the unmated have no means of making their whereabouts
known, save by thus giving tongue to desire.
Evidently the normal methods of voice production do not
suffice for their urgent needs, for the carrying power of
the voice is immensely fortified by means of great air
sacs, or chambers, formed in part by an enlargement
of the body of the hyoid, or the bone which supports
the tongue, and in part by dilatations of the inner walls
of the larynx. The females, it is to be noted, are by
no means so well equipped in this matter. It is not
necessary that they should be. All that those desiring
mates have to do is to follow up the cries of avid males,
a by no means difficult task, especially when under the
spell of the emotions which possess them. But the
mechanism which serves the Chimpanzee and the Gorilla
by no means fulfils the needs of the Orang-utan. In this
uncouth creature the system of resonating chambers is
immensely increased by great, thin-walled, membranous
pouches extending round the neck and under the armpits,
so that when inflated these areas have a most extraordinarily
swollen appearance. When the Orang chooses
to lift his voice even the deaf must hear.</p>

<p>Where fighting instead of fondling is the sequel to
these impassioned cries the conflict is probably not of
long duration, for it is certainly severe. This is attested
by the fact that captured specimens, if adult, are commonly
found to be minus one or more fingers, which have
been bitten or torn off in these love affairs.</p>

<p><i>From a drawing by I. Thornton.</i></p>

<p class="center">THE GORILLA PREPARING FOR HOSTILITIES.</p>

<p>Note the “beetling” brows, the large size of the canine teeth, and the great development of the arms in these
arboreal creatures, which play an even more important part in locomotion than the legs. The latter in this
illustration are, however, relatively too small.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 42.</p></div>

<p>An added ferocity of expression is given to the male
Gorilla by the development of enormous brow ridges
and the huge canines. The former are regarded by some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>authorities as adaptations to afford increased powers
of mastication. But if this were so, then such ridges
should be equally developed in both sexes, and this is
far from being true. Hideousness, rather than ferocity,
has been given to the Orang-utan by the out-growth of
enormous ridges on each side of the face, and these,
when the great wind-bags encircling the neck are inflated,
impart a repulsiveness of expression attained by no
other animal living.</p>

<p>Of the normal every-day life of the great Apes but little
is known. It would seem, however, that they live in
family parties—an adult male accompanied by a female
and one or more young of different ages, of which one
is commonly an infant in arms. It is difficult to procure
positive evidence on the point, but it is commonly believed
that the young remain with their parents till they are
several years old, when they are gradually driven off
to fend for themselves. This is a common procedure
with all animals. The dominant impulse in this is something
akin to greediness, an indefinable perception that
too large a family party will entail too great a strain
on the food supply, hence the now no longer helpless
young are regarded as a danger to the safety of the
family, and are turned adrift. Incidentally this procedure
is of immense benefit to the race, for it ensures its distribution,
enlarges its chances of survival, and lessens the
danger of in-breeding.</p>

<p>Attention must now be turned to the lower Apes. In
these it is to be remarked the secondary sexual characters
differ conspicuously from those of the man-like species.
Manes and beards and brightly-coloured areas of bare
skin are now the dominant feature. But canine teeth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>in proportion rivalling those of the Gorilla, are found in
the Baboons, while in some of the New-world monkeys
voice production of quite remarkable power takes the
place of ornament.</p>

<p>The precise part played by ornament among these
animals can only be inferred from Darwin’s observations
on captive animals, and then only in so far as they refer
to colour. Manes, beards and moustaches, such as are
shown in the adjoining illustrations, are borne only by
the males, and sometimes take extravagant forms.</p>

<p>Darwin suggested that the mane of the Baboons, for
example, served as a shield when fighting with rivals,
protecting the great blood-vessels from injury. Incidentally
this end may be attained, but from what we know
of similar developments in other animals, this cannot
be regarded as the primary function of the mane. One
is tempted to look upon it as a protective device because
of its position, but it is probably no more so than is the
long flowing hair which adorns the flanks of the Guereza.
This is of a purely ornamental character, although,
according to some, it is to be reckoned as an instance of
protective coloration, the long white hair matching
the long pendant masses of lichen which hang from the
boughs of the trees in the damp forests where these
creatures live, and so concealing them from their enemies.
Of beards and moustaches many examples might be
cited, but the most striking must suffice. These are furnished
by the Satan Monkey or Black Saki (<i>Pithecia
satanas</i>), and the little Tamarin Monkey (<i>Midas imperator</i>)—one
of the Marmosets. In the first-named the beard is
thick and full, but in the latter scanty. This, however,
is atoned for by the enormous upwardly curled moustache
giving the face a most comically human appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><p class="right">Plate 3.</p>
<img src="images/i_fp044.jpg" width="500" height="722" alt="" />
<p><i>From drawings by I. Thornton.</i></p>

<p class="center">THE BAROMETER OF MALENESS—AMONG THE APES.</p>

<p>All the Man-like Apes possess great canine teeth and powerful voices. In the Orangutan
the Compass of the voice is enormously heightened by means of a huge wind-bag
which encircles the neck. The wind-bag is seen in fig. 1, which also shows the great
folds of skin developed by adult males on each side of the face. In other species, as in
the Tamarin Marmoset (<i>Midas imperator</i>) (fig. 2), and the Satan monkey (<i>Pithecia
satanus</i>) (fig. 3), “ornaments” in the shape of beards and moustaches are developed,
while in the Mandrill (fig. 4) the face is vividly coloured.</p>
<p class="right">[Face page 44.</p></div>

<p>In the development of brilliantly-coloured areas of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>bare skin the monkeys stand alone among the Mammalia.
The hues displayed are remarkable for their brilliancy,
and this varies in intensity, waxing and waning with
the varying moods of their possessors, and attaining
their maximum during periods of sexual excitement.
Blue, green, red, and violet are the dominant
colours, and these are confined to the face, buttocks,
and genital organs. The same hues are commonly present
in both sexes, though in the female they are less
brilliant. Normally the male appears to be unconscious
of the conspicuous patches of colour, but when under
the irrepressible stimulus of sexual excitement he seems
to endeavour to make the utmost possible capital out of
such adornments, more especially presenting his buttocks
to his mate in an apparent endeavour to stimulate her
desire. In some species, as with the Baboons for example,
the naked area of this hinder part of the body is a much
more conspicuous feature in the female than in the male,
becoming enormously swollen and carunculated, and from
its vivid red colour presents a positively revolting appearance,
according to our standard of what is beautiful.
The most vividly coloured species of all is the Mandrill,
which, in this matter exceeds all other living Mammals.
The face, in the male, is produced forward to give the
head a dog-like shape, while the whole of the upper surface
of the muzzle has been transformed into a swollen, deeply fluted
mass by the excessive inflation of the underlying
bone. The bare skin covering this is of a brilliant cobalt
blue, with lines of violet in the furrows, while the nose
is of a bright scarlet. The naked skin of the buttocks,
and the genital organs, are suffused with brilliant tints of
scarlet and blue. In spite of the purity and brilliance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>coloration the effect is to make the creature really hideous.</p>

<p>Of the display Cuvier writes: “La partie postérieure
du corps n’est ni moins extraordinaire ni moins révoltante.
Sous une courte queue sans cesse relevée est un anus
entouré d’un gros bourrelet d’écarlate; de larges fesses
nues, que l’animal semble montrer sans cesse avec autant
de lascivité que d’impudence, sont colorées d’un rose
vif nuancé sur les côtés de lilas et de bleu. Les parties
genitales enfin sont d’un rouge de feu d’autant plus tranché
qu’elles sont absolument nues, et qu’elles viennent
a la suite d’un abdomen revêtu de poils blancs.”</p>

<p>While we cannot suppose these animals to possess any
standard of beauty or ugliness, it must not be forgotten
that they are more or less conscious, not only of the
existence of these brightly-coloured areas, but of the effect
they produce, as Darwin showed long since in the cases of
a captive Mandrill, and some other smaller species of
Monkeys, among them a Rhesus Monkey. These, when
shown a looking-glass, at once presented their hinder
ends to what they supposed to be the new arrival. A
similar mark of friendliness was shown towards their
keeper, and visitors introduced by him. Periodically,
under the sexual stimulus, this desire becomes intensified
and becomes an invitation to mating.</p>

<p>In this connection it is interesting to note that in some
of the Macaque Monkeys we have signs of a reversal
of the usual sequence of coloration. For in the Pigtailed
Macaque the young of both sexes are more brilliantly
coloured than the adults, in regard to the bare skin areas,
while in the Hairy-eared Macaque (<i>M. lasiotis</i>) and the
Rhesus Monkey (<i>M. rhesus</i>) the face of the female is
brighter than that of the male. This surely means that
this coloration is in process of suppression, for according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>to the rule the male is the first to develop new characters,
then the female, and finally they are transmitted to the
young. The extra brightness in the young, then, is to
be regarded not as an incipient, but as an ancestral
character in process of elimination.</p>

<p>As a rule, among the Mammals at any rate, brilliant
coloration and weapons of offence are not associated in
the same animal. The Baboons, and the Mandrill in
particular, are exceptions, for these animals are provided
with most formidable “tusks,” the canines of both upper
and lower jaws being of great size, and opposed one to
another in such a way that they wear away to form
sharp, angular cutting-edges, more murderous than the
fangs of the Tiger.</p>

<p>Reference has been made already to the existence of
large sound resonators for the purpose of increasing the
volume of the voice in the Orang, Gorilla and Chimpanzee.
Some of the Gibbons are also well provided in
this direction. But the most striking instances of the
kind are furnished by the Orang, and the monkeys known
as Howlers. In these last the base of the hyoid, as the
skeleton for the support of the tongue is called, is fashioned
into a deep bony cup, which has the effect of intensifying
the volume of the voice to a most surprising extent. But
more than this, apparently for the protection of this bony
voice-bowl the upright branches of the lower jaw have
become remarkably deepened, and widened, a correlation
of growth between unrelated parts which is fraught with
deep significance. “Terrific,” “terrible” and “harrowing”
are terms which have been used by travellers like
Bates, Belt and Wallace in describing the cavernous roar
of these animals, a roar which will easily carry two miles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>It would seem that these vocal efforts are not merely
confined to what we may call the “Courting” season, as
is the roar of the stag, but that they are heard nightly
at dusk. They may be resumed again at dawn, and
re-awakened when thunder-clouds gather. They have
become the normal method of giving vent to excitement,
and probably are intensified when isolated males are
desirous of discovering the whereabouts of females equally
anxious to find a mate.</p>

<p>Among the Apes we meet, as with the human species,
with both monogamy and polygamy. But it would be
dangerous to assume that the reasons for polygamy are
the same in both. Polygamy, indeed, has by no means
always the same significance. In the most primitive,
half-human races of the past, as with the man-like Apes
to-day, polygamy is determined by accident rather than
choice. These extinct peoples, like the great anthropoids,
were normally monogamous, but on the death of a male
in conflict with his neighbour, or from other causes, his
mate would probably of her own free will seek out the
nearest male and even if he were already mated would
be at once adopted into the family circle. This certainly
happens in the case of the Gorilla and Chimpanzee to-day.
But among living races of mankind, both savage and
civilized, multiplicity of wives is a matter of choice on
the part of the male, and in many cases to achieve this
females from other tribes have to be secured—either by
purchase or conquest. With the lower apes, or “monkeys,”
polygamy only obtains among gregarious species;
and either because the birth-rate of the females exceeds that
of the males, or because a considerable number of young
males are killed annually by exciting the jealousy of the
older males, who are exceedingly pugnacious.</p>

<p>From Apes to Antelopes is a far cry, but contrasts are
always helpful. Antelopes and Deer, Zebras and Elephants,
Rhinoceroses and Swine, are types, taken at
random, of that great and important group of animals
known as the “Ungulates,” or “Hoofed” animals. These
illustrate in a very striking manner what is meant by
the term “Secondary Sexual Characters.” They demonstrate
no less forcibly what is meant by the term “Sexual
Selection.” They are valuable in this connection, because
of the often formidable weapons, in the shape of horns
and tusks, which so many species have developed during
the struggle for mates.</p>

<p>But “Sexual Selection” will not explain their origin,
and it is difficult, in the present state of our knowledge,
to discover any clues which will reveal this. In seeking
these there are certain broad aspects of the problem which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>are not to be lost sight of. In the first place, horns, at
any rate, are confined to the hoofed animals. That the
various types of hoofed animals, living and extinct, have
had a common ancestry, no one at the present day will
probably call in question. The relationship, however,
of the various living types, one to another, is by no means
always apparent: the missing links are to be sought in
the records of the rocks.</p>

<p>When the whole of the evidence comes to be surveyed,
and not till then, it becomes apparent that this wonderful
diversity is the result of complex factors. That the conditions
of existence have controlled the results is beyond
question; but it is equally certain that these conditions
have been merely controlling and not causative. In
other words, we must regard each of these different groups
or types—Deer, Antelopes, Horses, Elephants, Swine, and
so on—as witnesses of what we call “Heredity.” They
are so many “Diathetic types.” That is to say, the
forms, or individuals, belonging to each type have inherited
certain peculiarities in common; they display a “Diathesis”
as the doctors call it: an inherent, inborn tendency, or
habit of growth, in a definite direction: a tendency which,
ever and anon, develops new qualities, takes new directions.
And thus it is that we get Oxen—using this term
in its widest sense and not in its special sense—Antelopes,
Goats and Sheep, for example. These have, among other
things, a “diathesis” in the direction of horn production,
and each, too, of a different type. What is meant by
this apparently mystifying term “diathesis” will perhaps
be made clear by taking the case of the Ox and the Sheep.
While very different in appearance, these live on precisely
similar food; yet no one has any difficulty in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>discriminating between the taste of beef and mutton. In
the marvellous chemical laboratory of the body the grass
gathered in the same field is converted into flesh which
even in its uncooked state is easily distinguishable.
Though for the purposes of this illustration domesticated
animals have been used, the same is true of their wild
relations. Sportsmen tell us that the various types of
Antelopes and the Zebra, which may be seen feeding
together, have yet flesh of very different qualities. These
qualities are to be attributed neither to “Natural” nor to
“Sexual” selection; they are “accidents.” Similarly,
their horns are the witness of a horn-producing
“diathesis”: the various divergencies in curvature,
and in the form of their spirals, or the number of their
encircling rings—as in the horns of Antelopes—are to be
interpreted in like fashion. These twists and turns vary
in the same way that the taste of the flesh varies, and
for the same reason; that is to say, they are not the outcome
of “Sexual Selection,” nor have they been brought
about by “Natural Selection” to serve the purpose of
“Recognition marks,” as Wallace would have us believe.</p>

<p>But horns, as horns, apart from their “accidents”
of curvature and ornament, must certainly be regarded as
the product of Sexual selection, for having once started
into being those individuals had the best chance of leaving
descendants which were best armed. The possession of
horns was not necessary to the maintenance of the species;
but such armature was essential among the males in
securing possession of the females. Other things being
equal, the male with the biggest horns wins the prize.
Since these are also used as weapons of offence, or
rather of defence, in warding off the attacks of beasts
of prey, it might be contended that they are as much
the product of Natural selection as of Sexual selection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>It soon becomes apparent that this interpretation
must fail. In the first place, if it were true, the females
should be similarly armed. In the second, in the presence
of many of their enemies they are useless. The Cape
hunting-dog, for example, is more than a match for any
antelope. This ferocious animal kills his victim by
running it down, persistently tearing at its flanks, until
at last the entrails protrude and the horrid chase is ended.
Furthermore, the horns are a comparatively late acquirement
of the species, as is shown in the case of the Deer;
for the earliest known fossil species were hornless. That
the females among the Oxen and many of the Antelopes
possess horns is an interesting fact, but it can only be
regarded as another instance of a character first acquired
by the male and later, in successive generations, transferred
to the female. And it is to be noticed that this transference
is never found save in the cases where the character
in question has attained its maximum in the male. The
transference of weapons to the female is the more remarkable
because there is no evidence that they play any
part in the struggle for existence, either in securing mates
or in warding off the attacks of enemies. Moreover,
these weapons in the female may exceed those of the
male, in length, though they are never so massive. They
are to be regarded solely in the light of ornaments. There
are few more striking instances indeed where the purely
ornamental and the strictly utilitarian are so closely
associated.</p>

<p>Horns of various types furnish the most conspicuous of the
“Secondary Sexual Characters” of the ruminants. In the Deer
only are these branched. In the “hollow-horned” ruminants they
are either lance-like or more or less spirally curved, or they may

<p>Attention may now profitably be turned to the
behaviour of these interesting tribes when under the
alluring influences of love.</p>

<p>Tradition and the poets have contrived to persuade us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>that the fever of Love becomes epidemic in the spring.
This, however, is by no means true, at any rate in so far
as what we are pleased to call the “lower animals” are
concerned. For with many, as for example the Deer
and the Bats, this fever is not aroused till the time of
autumn plenty. With regard to the deer, we can find
a reason for this. It is determined in part by the period
of gestation, and in part by the peculiar character of the
most conspicuous of the male secondary sexual characters—the
antlers. The deer, at any rate of the northern
hemisphere, carry their young about eight months. Now
it is important that they should make their entry into the
world just as the food supply is increasing and the temperature
is rising. With the summer before them the
young have time to gather strength for the encounter
with their first winter. We have a striking witness to the
truth of this contention in the fact that when the Indian
Spotted Deer, or Chital, was first introduced into Europe,
nearly all the fawns perished owing to having been born
in winter; later, the females took to calving in spring,
and from thence onwards the species has held its own
among us.</p>

<p>As touching the stags. The antlers, as everybody
knows, are shed annually, and their renewal entails a very
considerable strain on the system. As a consequence,
it is necessary that this period of stress should fall after
the trial of winter is overpast, and with the genial summer
before them. From the end of March, when the old
weapons are shed, till July, the masterful males of the
community wander at large, seeking seclusion and avoiding
all occasion of quarrel; for they are not only defenceless,
but threatened with disaster should any accident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>befall the growing horns, which, during their formation,
are exceedingly sensitive. Even a slight blow would not
only spoil their shapely proportions, but, further, might
render them useless in the warfare that is before them.</p>

<p>With some species this desire to go into retreat is more
marked than in others. The Red-deer, and the Wapiti,
on the one hand, and the Moose on the other, well illustrate
this. The two first-named pass the winter in herds,
in the case of the Wapiti numbering many thousand
individuals; no other species, indeed, is so markedly
gregarious. With the advance of the spring, however,
all is changed, for the males withdraw from their companions
to suffer humiliation in seclusion. As chill
October arrives, a striking alteration in their demeanour
becomes apparent, at any rate in the case of the older
males. The new antlers are now hardened, and the blood
supply, which has hitherto been building up the new
weapons, is cut off. As a consequence, the “velvet,”
which till now has been directly concerned with the growth
of the antlers, dies, and peels off the underlying bone.
To facilitate this work of cleaning, the animal rubs them,
first against the stems of saplings, and, later, against
larger trees, and even rocks, till at last they are ready for
“battle, murder and sudden death.” The “rutting”
season, in short, has commenced. And with the final
completion of the antlers other signs of that approaching
frenzy, which is soon to establish itself, become apparent.
The most striking of these are the swelling of the neck, and
a marked increase in the mane thereof; while the voice
enlarges its compass enormously, whereby the females,
so long neglected, are now feverishly sought for.</p>

<p>The “stags” do not begin to call for mate’s until the horns have more
or less completely shed their velvet.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 54.</p></div>

<p>The Red-deer, maddened with desire, scours the country,
calling as he travels with a loud musical roar, ever and
anon impatiently listening for the tremulous response of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>females hardly less anxious to mate than himself. One
after another is speedily added to his harem, but not
without conflict. For sooner or later he catches the call
of another stag in like case. A jealous fury at once takes
possession of him, and the call, intended as a message to
mateless hinds, becomes translated into a challenge to fight
for the mates possessed. Each of the now infuriated
challengers makes all haste to come to blows, and speedily
they are rushing headlong on one another to meet in a
crash of antlers. Then follows a test of strength, a sort
of tug-of-war reversed, for each strives to push the other
to his knees, and succeeding, to deal a deadly sideways
thrust at the kneeling adversary’s heart with the spike-shaped
brow-tines. This attempt, however, is rarely
achieved. Yet not seldom such encounters become a
duel to the death, and one in which both die, for in the
remorseless tilt at one another the antlers of one may
spring apart, and then close in on those of the other.
Once this happens, it seems to be rare indeed that they
can be extricated from this close embrace. With heads
thus locked, they sway, and twist, and tug, not now for
the mastery, but for life itself. But as the hours run they
become more and more exhausted by their efforts, weaker
and weaker from loss of food and rest, till finally death
releases both.</p>

<p>A male having once succeeded in forming a harem,
will commonly contrive to repeat his success year after
year, withstanding all comers. But sooner or later his
vigour wanes and he is ousted by another and younger
male. Not else would the stamina of the race be preserved.
It is considered a moot point, however, whether
physical strength and sexual potency run at the same pace;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>for it is believed by some that a stag will often contrive
to hold a harem against all rivals after his fertility has
declined. This, however, is extremely improbable. A
lowering of fertility means a decline in the potency of
the hormones, and in the development of the secondary
sexual characters, among which are the antlers, which
are by no means negligible factors. That they are not
all-important, however, seems to be shown by the fact
that, occasionally, stags appear in a herd which are
congenitally unable to produce antlers—a reversion to the
ancestral condition—and such are said, occasionally at
any rate, to be able to oust their formidably armed rivals.
This may be so, but the fact that “hummel” stags, as
they are called, are so rare is surely to be regarded as
eloquent testimony of the disadvantages of their unarmoured
state. They become speedily eliminated, in
short, by “Sexual Selection.”</p>

<p>After this outburst of sexual activity has spent itself,
the various harems, with their lords, amalgamate; all
living in peace through the winter. The stags retain their
antlers at this season, partly as a protection against
predatory enemies, such as wolves, and other large carnivores,
which would otherwise play havoc in their ranks,
and partly because the cold of winter and scanty fodder
would inhibit the growth of new antlers or reduce their
size. With the return of spring the dangers of attack
are lessened, temperature rises, and food becomes once
more plentiful. Then the inevitable disarmament takes
place.</p>

<p>The Red-deer, though mature at six, does not reach his
prime till his eleventh year, and from thence till his
fifteenth or sixteenth year is at his best. The hinds
mature earlier, and appear to be fertile for a much longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>period. At any rate, a wild hind in Jura, known by
certain peculiarities of its ears, during twenty-one years
produced twenty calves. She was killed at last with a
calf at her side, but was thin and haggard-looking. She
was, therefore, not less than six-and-twenty at her death.
The calves, it may be mentioned, are born in May and
June.</p>

<p>Old stags shed their antlers, it is remarked, earlier than
young ones. And this is an advantage to the species,
since it prevents premature breeding on the part of
sexually precocious but immature males, and limits
competition to the adults.</p>

<p>What obtains in the case of the Red-deer obtains also
with minor variations due to environment, climate, and
so on, in the case of all other deer. The life-history of the
Wapiti, as might be supposed, differs only in detail from
that of the Red-deer. But during the winter they form
vast herds, numbering thousands. It may be that in
primitive times the Red-deer was no less numerous. But
in this country, at any rate, conditions favourable to the
maximum development, either in bodily size, or in the
massiveness of the antlers, have long since passed away.
Even in the Highlands of Scotland the conditions of
existence have entirely changed owing to disafforestation.
Deer are essentially forest dwellers. But the “deer forests”
are such only in name, and for the most part
the wild stags of to-day must get what shelter they can
from rocks and inequalities of the ground. From this
cause, and from the very natural desire of the owners
of such “forests” to secure the finest heads in each year,
the whole race has deteriorated. How great a change has
come over it may be seen by comparing the heads of
British Stags with those from German forests, where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>conditions of existence are more favourable. If we turn
to the records of the past we find that the antlers found
in the fens, turbaries, and caverns of our islands are vastly
larger, heavier, and carry a greater number of points on
the sur-royals, than do those of the existing Scotch stags.</p>

<p>Having regard to the fact that hundreds, and in the
distant past thousands, of antlers were shed annually,
the comparative rarity of these weapons in the haunts
of deer excites comment. This is accounted for by the
fact that they are greedily eaten by their late owners,
apparently, though unconsciously, for the sake of their
bone-producing qualities.</p>

<p>By way of contrast with the Red-deer and Wapiti, we
may take the Moose (<i>Alces machlis</i>), which at no time,
and nowhere, attains to large herds. This is explained
by the relatively restricted food supply which obtains
in the haunts of these creatures. For they frequent the
margins of streams, feeding largely on willows and birch.
From the shortness of their necks, and the great length
of their legs, they cannot crop grass and other short
herbage, for unless they kneel they cannot reach the
ground. Hence it is obvious that though their geographical
range may be wide, their numbers are kept rigidly in check.
They would be fewer still but for the fact that, unlike other
deer, they glean no small amount of food from the water,
wading out to feed upon aquatic vegetation. The roots
of water-lilies are especially sought for, and to obtain
these the animal will often disappear entirely under
water.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the limited food supply the Moose
lead solitary lives. On the Eastern side of America, where
the winter is severe, a few individuals, generally a family
party, will “yard up,” or make a fortress for their mutual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>protection by trampling down the snow over a restricted
area. But in the Yukon district, my friend Mr. F. C.
Selous tells me this is never done.</p>

<p>The rutting season of the bulls begins as soon as the
antlers begin to “peel.” What follows is practically a
repetition of what has already been related in regard to
the Red-deer and Wapiti. And in this connection it is
interesting to note that the natives take advantage of the
period of desire in the bull to entice him to his death.
Generally this is done by imitating the call of the cow
in response to the bull’s anxious bellowing. But in
Southern Alaska the opposite side of his nature is played
upon. This is done by scraping or beating the bushes
with the shoulder-blade of a Moose in such a way as to
reproduce the sound of a bull cleaning his horns. The very
suspicion of a rival enrages him, and, rushing in a blind
fury in the direction of the tell-tale sounds, he speedily
falls a victim to the trick which has been played him.</p>

<p>That the mating period is the most critical, and most
searching in the whole life-history there can be no doubt.
Every faculty during this time is put to the test, and from
the time of sexual maturity until old age is at last attained
it is an annual test. Alertness is all important. Other
things being equal, success falls most certainly to those
individuals with the keenest perception, and quickest
interpretation of sight, sound and smell.</p>

<p>One is puzzled at what seems a concession of Darwin’s
to the Lamarckian theory of the inherited effects of use in
this connection. For in discussing the bellowing of the
stag in “The Descent of Man,” he remarks that it “does
not seem to be of any special service to him, either during
courtship or battles, or in any other way. But may we
not believe that the frequent use of the voice, under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>strong excitement of love, jealousy and rage, continued
during many generations, may at last have produced an
inherited effect on the vocal organs of the stag, as well as of
other male animals?” All the evidence goes to show that
the production of sound, and the instant interpretation of
its significance, is a matter of the highest importance. In
the case of the Moose, for example, the noise occasioned
by the cleaning of antlers provokes the same frenzy as at
another time is aroused by the voice. Dullness of perception
not only in these matters, but at all times, is fatal.</p>

<p>As touching the less conspicuous secondary sexual
characters of Deer more must be said presently. For the
moment the antlers must retain our attention. Time
was when the Deer lacked these appendages. When they
first appeared, in the now extinct species of the Middle
Miocene period, they were no more than short prongs.
Later, one of the prongs became elongated, and developed
short branches or “tines,” which, in succeeding species,
became more numerous, while at the same time, with the
gradual evolution of more and more species, these antlers
assumed new features both in the matter of size and in
the character and number of the “tines,” a development
which has reached its maximum to-day. But apart from
these specific variations, which have given us such types as
those of the Roe-deer, Red-deer, Wapiti, Caribou, Moose,
Fallow-deer, Sambar, Schombergk’s deer, the strange
Milou-deer, Elds-deer and Mule-deer, each species displays
a quite remarkable range of variation in regard to its
particular type of antler. Nowhere, perhaps, is this
more strikingly marked than in the case of the Caribou
and Moose. No doubt this feature is due largely to the
fact that the horns are shed annually, and that the
variations are due, in part at any rate, to temporary
environmental conditions, such as food and weather.
But these apart, individual peculiarities are constant,
reappearing with more or less exactness each year.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 60.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>In contemplating these facts one asks: What are the
underlying factors of this variability? What is the
significance of the branching? What end is attained by
the annual shedding? That the antlers constitute very
effective weapons of offence there can be no doubt, and
one is inclined to regard the branching as the outcome of
natural selection, on the assumption that branched antlers
would be less deadly than lance-like weapons. It would
perhaps be tempting to accept this interpretation as all
sufficient were it not for the evidence afforded by the
hollow-horned ruminants. The Oryx and the Kudu, for
example, are lance-bearers, and therefore show conclusively
that stags similarly armed might well have continued to
survive in spite of the foils which the “tines” provide.
Darwin, long since, guardedly suggested that while these
weapons primarily served for offensive purposes, their
elaborate systems of branching might have been brought
about by sexual selection. That is to say, the extreme
beauty of the weapons may excite the admiration of the
females as well as our own. Granting this, he inferred
they might have played an important part in elaborating
the branching by constantly displaying a preference to
mate with those males possessed of the largest and most
branched antlers. But there are many and serious
objections to this suggestion, and the most important
of all is the fact that the female is allowed no choice in
the selection of her lord and master. We can, then, only
regard the antlers of deer as another instance of the
survival of a “fortuitous” but inherent variation, which
survived because, whatever the defects thereof, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>proved advantageous in the struggle for existence.</p>

<p>Having regard to the fact that so many of the females
among the hollow-horned ruminants have acquired horns,
it is somewhat remarkable that in the Reindeer alone
among the deer are these weapons normally possessed
by the female. The gradual transference to the female
of features which were originally secondary sexual
characters in the male is an occurrence which is met
with in every group of animals. In writing “The Infancy
of Animals” I gave a number of instances of this kind.
But the case of the Reindeer affords a more than usually
striking illustration of this curious sequence; and this
because rudiments of antlers are to be met with among
the females in several different species of Deer to-day.
They have been found in the females of both Roe- and
Red-deer, though such cases are rarely met with. As
a rule this assumption of the male secondary sexual
characters by the female occurs only in very aged animals,
or as one of the sequelæ of diseased ovaries and consequent
sterility. But at least one instance is on record
of a doe Roe-deer which possessed small antlers while
pregnant. Thus, then, we gain a further insight into
the process by which the female slowly assumes the outward
attributes of the male; that is to say, the secondary
sexual characters appear first in the male, and as seasonal
characters. Sooner or later they become permanently
established. By the time they have become firmly fixed
in the male, and apparently not till then, they appear
in a dilute form during senility, or in consequence of
ovarian disease, in the female. Having once started,
however, they appear earlier and earlier in the life-history
of succeeding generations of females, and at last in the
juvenile stages of both sexes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>The hollow-horned ruminants, which must now be
considered, afford some very striking facts in regard to
these “secondary sexual characters,” more especially
in so far as horns are concerned. In the first place
these weapons are permanent structures, taking the form
of a bony core ensheathed in horn, with which we may
compare the temporary covering of velvet in the deer:
in the second, they are unbranched. The only exception
to this rule is furnished by the Prong-horned Antelope,
wherein the sheath is both annually shed, and branched.
The branching, however, is very slight, taking the form
of a short forwardly directed prong about half-way up
the sheath, which is borne on a long bony pedicle recalling
that of the Muntjac. The shedding is due to the formation
of new horn material at the base of the old sheath,
which is gradually forced off by the growth of the new
tissue. Structurally the horn of this remarkable Antelope
differs somewhat from that of its relatives.</p>

<p>As may be seen in Plate 4, in the form of the
horns the typical hollow-horned ruminants present an
exceedingly varied range, and one often of great beauty
in the matter of curvature. That they serve as formidable
weapons of offence was demonstrated during
1912, when, according to the Annual Report of the
Government Game Reserves, published by the Pretoria
Government, the game warden, Major Stevenson
Hamilton, reported of the Antelopes that “many carcases
of males of almost all species, killed in single combat
with rivals, were found during the mating season, untouched
by anything except vultures.” As a rule, however,
these animals, like the Sheep and Goats, and their
larger relatives the Cattle, seem to avoid a duel to
the death. One or two instances as to the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>character of these combats for the possession of mates
must suffice. Thus the late A. H. Neumann, a hunter
of experience, remarks that he once or twice saw conflicts
between the Topi (<i>Damaliscus jimela</i>), an ally of the
Hartebeestes. The two rivals would stand a little apart,
affecting, apparently, to be unaware of one another’s
presence. Suddenly they would rush headlong at one
another, bringing their heads together with a clash, each,
at the same moment, falling on his knees.</p>

<p>Major Powell Cotton, again, once witnessed an affray
between two Beisa Oryx. Here the master bull of the
herd was infuriated by the advent of an intruder in his
harem. Time after time they dashed at each other, their
foreheads meeting with a thud; then, with horns interlocked,
they wrestled fiercely; then, separating, they
charged again. Yet neither, he remarks, tried to use his
lance-points, as they do when cornered by man or beasts
of prey. Nevertheless, encounters of a more sanguinary
character appear to be by no means rare, for it is no uncommon
experience of hunters to kill bulls of this species in
which one eye has been burst by a horn-thrust. Another
peculiarity of these animals is the extreme thickness of
the hide of the neck and withers, which seems to afford a
shield against such spear-thrusts during these battles.
How powerful is the thrust of these weapons, and how
efficiently they can be used, is shown by the fact
that lions in making an attack on an old bull are often
severely wounded, or even killed. And there are many
instances on record of cases where both the lion and his
intended victim have died together, the Antelope having
been unable to withdraw his horns from his adversary’s
body. The beautiful Pala Antelope fights furiously with
rival rams, and the vanquished, as with so many of the
Antelopes, form herds by themselves, till one by one they
gather strength and skill enough to establish their right
to mate.</p>

<p>The Elands present some puzzling features, for both
sexes bear large horns, and they are very massive in the
bulls. Yet these animals are generally described as the
most inoffensive of all the horned ruminants. That the
horns are used to any extent in conflicts between rival
males seems doubtful, inasmuch as this species is remarkable
for the development of an enormous “dewlap,” a
thin pendulous fold of skin which runs from the throat
to the chest. Such a form of “ornament”—for in this
light we must regard it—would be dangerous, indeed,
when much fighting was to be done. Nevertheless, it
would be contrary to all our experience to conclude that
weapons so well developed as are the horns of the bull
Eland were entirely useless. This is a matter which
decidedly calls for further investigation.</p>

<p>That our knowledge of that most important period of
life of the larger mammals, the period of sexual exaltation,
is lamentably incomplete will be realized by anyone who
seeks enlightenment on this subject. Most of the meagre
information we possess has been collected by travellers
and sportsmen, neither of whom have the time to devote
to the long and laborious watches that a fuller history
demands. Every now and then a glimpse is afforded of
this period of the life-history which brings home in a very
convincing fashion, how little is really known. It seems
certain that the fighting hitherto described is to be
regarded as but a phase of a cycle of events which takes
place at this time. Thus, for example, the old naturalist
and traveller Schweinfurth tells how he once encountered
a herd of Hartebeest which were apparently effervescing
with animal spirits, for they kept running around in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>couples, like horses in a circus, using a clump of trees as
a pivot. Others, in groups of three or four, stood by,
interested spectators. After a time these, in turn, took
their places and ran round, two at a time, in their own
circuit, and in the same fashion. Their evolutions, he
says, were so regular as to suggest the guidance of some
invisible ring-master. These gyrations may be regarded
as an erotic dance. The Sambar, under like excitement,
will stalk about with erected tail, outstretched muzzle
and everted face glands, and the Black-buck, among the
antelopes, behaves in like fashion.</p>

<p>It cannot be supposed that these quaint performances
are peculiar to the species in which they have been
observed, but rather it may be inferred that similar
antics, besides others yet to be discovered, are performed
by all. Their purpose seems plain enough, for they
must be regarded surely as aphrodisiacs, excitants to
pairing. They recall the erotic dances of savages, or the
ceremonial orgies of ancient civilizations. Such performances,
on an even more elaborate scale, are to be
met with among the birds.</p>

<p>So far, in describing the horned ruminants, the horns
only have been considered; but these animals display
yet other secondary sexual characters, which, while less
conspicuous, are yet no less important during this critical
period of life. Some, as for instance the canine teeth
possessed by some of the deer, are decidedly puzzling.
While absent, or vestigial, in most, in a few they are
greatly developed, and this, too, in species which
possess relatively large horns, as in the Muntjac. It
seems difficult to believe that the co-existence of
these very different kinds of weapons can be of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>vital importance to their possessors; yet unless this
be so, one or other would surely have degenerated.
It is significant that in the hornless Musk-deer these
teeth attain to a very considerable length, at their
maximum as much as three inches. That they are used
by rival males, and with effect, is shown by the fact that
the hides of these animals are often found scored by deep
lines cut by these tusks. In those aberrant ruminants,
the Camels, quite formidable tusks are present both in
the upper and lower jaws, and these are used with effect
whenever occasion demands, and often when it does not.</p>

<p>The armoury necessary for successful love-making
contains yet other weapons, evolved to supplement
physical force, and more subtle in their effect. Such are
certain skin glands which, at the rutting season, secrete
a copious flow of a creamy, or semi-fluid matter, and pungent
odour. In the deer the more important of these are
found in the deep pit, or “larmier,” which opens in front
of the eye. In the Musk-deer, however, this secretion
has a most powerful odour of musk, and is formed in
a pouch, or “pod,” of about the size of a small orange,
under the skin of the abdomen. The secretion, which is
formed by the male only, is of a chocolate colour, and of
about the consistence of moist gingerbread. It has a most
pungent scent, and when diluted forms the basis of many
of our most powerful and most highly-prized perfumes,
on which account, it may be mentioned, this animal has
for generations been submitted to a most unrelenting
persecution. But that is another story.</p>

<p>In most of the antelopes the principal scent gland is
seated in a pit in front of the eye, as in the deer. In some,
as in the Gnu, it forms instead a swollen, tumid area,
oblong in shape, instead of lying in a pit. In the Reedbuck
it is placed around the bases of the horns; and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>the Rocky-Mountain Goat it forms a great bare cushion
behind the horns. All have more or less well-developed
glands seated in the skin between the toes. But, wherever
placed, the secretions thereof are more or less completely
suspended save during the breeding season, when they
are poured forth abundantly. The precise rôle they play
is by no means certainly known. It seems reasonable
to suppose that, in the first place, the odour they disperse
enables the males to announce their whereabouts
to the females seeking mates, should they fail to hear
their bellowing. But the antelopes, for the most part,
unlike deer, do not, the year round, lose touch with one
another; so that it must be concluded that these odours
serve as excitants to the act of pairing, and we know
that the sense of smell plays a very important part at this
time, which, so far as these animals are concerned, is the
only period which comes more or less exactly within the
meaning of the term “courtship.”</p>

<p>That scent among the antelopes holds a really important
place is shown by the fact that the bull of the
common Eland intensifies his natural odours by micturating
upon the mass of long hair which grows upon
the forehead. To do this the head is bent down and
turned tailwards, in order that the tuft should receive its
due urinary spray! And goats in captivity exhibit the
same curious habit. In them, indeed, it is often pushed
to such an excess that blindness results, so that the animal
has to be slaughtered.</p>

<p>While in many cases these odours are imperceptible
to human nostrils, in others this is far from being the
case. Among the ruminants the goat is particularly
odorous. So also are the giraffe and the water-buck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>both of which may be detected by their smell at considerable
distances. And these emanations are most
noticeable in the males and at the breeding season. The
bull elephant, both in the Indian and African species,
during the breeding season produces a copious flow of
aromatic matter from a gland which opens above the
eye in the form of a tubular aperture large enough to
admit a pencil. This aperture in the African elephant is
remarkable for the fact that it is invariably found to be
“plugged” with numerous spines of the acacia, which
have from time to time found their way in as the animal
was forcing its way through the dense undergrowth.
This extraordinary fact was first noticed by Mr. F. C.
Selous, and has since been confirmed by Dr. Einar
Lonnberg.</p>

<p>It is probable that the “bloody sweat,” which at times
covers the hide of the Hippopotamus just after leaving
the water, is associated with the period of rut. This
mysterious exudation is accompanied by small crystals;
but though red in colour, it contains no blood. So far
no reasonable explanation for this remarkable phenomenon
has ever been given, but probably it will be found
to be associated with the sexual activities and is possibly
odoriferous. A precisely similar exudation occurs in
the neck of the male of the Red Kangaroo.</p>

<p>That these secretions play an important and perhaps
variable part in the selection of mates seems demonstrated
in the case of an incident related to me by my friend
Mr. John Cooke, who some time ago was watching a flock
of some three hundred sheep while it was being driven by
the shepherd and his dogs into a field. As soon as they
were securely shut in, and the shepherd had gone, three
rams who were included in the flock at once began a three-cornered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>fight. One, presumably the youngest, was soon
vanquished. The other two soon settled their differences,
and the clashing of horns was at once followed by a very
different performance. The master ram began to run in and
out among the ewes, sniffing at each, and driving out those
whose odour most pleased him. Having at last satisfied
himself with a harem of about one hundred, the second
ram was allowed to make a like choice, and behaved in
a like manner, leaving the remainder to the ram which was
first vanquished. May we take it that the strongest
and oldest rams selected the youngest ewes, and the
oldest were left to the youngest, and first conquered
ram? By some such rough and ready method of selection
Nature may contrive that the immature male shall do as
little harm to the race as possible by mating with the
oldest, and in many cases barren females.</p>

<p>Our survey of the “hoofed” animals has so far been
confined to the ruminants. Space must now be found for
a brief review of what obtains under like circumstances
in the case of the great pachyderms—the Elephant,
Rhinoceros and Hippopotamus; the Pig and the Camel.</p>

<p class="center">ELEPHANTS.</p>

<p>The sexes differ but little in general appearance: and chiefly in the superior size
of the male and his more massive tusks.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 70.</p></div>

<p>As to actual “courtship” among these animals practically
nothing is known; but the varied and formidable
weapons which they possess are enough to show that
the secondary sexual characters play a very important part
in the preliminary capture of mates. That they may
also be used for the more prosaic purpose of securing food
is nothing to the point. In the Elephant, for example,
the tusks are sometimes of enormous size and weight,
specimens of eleven feet in length and weighing as much
as two hundred and fifty pounds are on record. They are
used for cutting through the bark of machabel trees,
which is then seized by the trunk and torn off, for
elephants are extremely fond of this bark; and they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>also turned to account in breaking up roots which have
been exposed by digging with the fore-feet. But this is
certainly not the main purpose of such weapons. On the
contrary, their use is primarily as weapons of offence
between rival bulls. As one would expect, they never
attain to a very large size in the female, but that they are
large enough to serve her at need is shown by the fact
that a portion of a tusk, evidently of a cow-elephant,
was once found embedded in the jaw of a bull. There
can be little doubt but that this was broken off in an
endeavour to repel the advances of a too amorous male,
for, as with all animals, pairing is impossible without the
consent of the female, and this is never accorded until
she is desirous that it should take place. As a preliminary
to this, an amorous dalliance is perhaps the invariable
rule among animals, and this takes many and often
strange forms. The Elephant affords a case in point.
For the late A. H. Neumann once came upon a pair which
were evidently, as he says, “love-making.” Creeping
upon them noiselessly, he found the male fondling his
mate with his trunk, and then, standing side by side,
they crossed their trunks, and put the tips thereof into
each other’s mouths, the elephantine form of kissing.
Deer, cattle and horses, cats and dogs, constantly lick one
another under like circumstances.</p>

<p>Superficial secondary sexual characters are wanting
both in the Hippopotamus and the Camel. Both, however,
possess a formidable armature of teeth which are
capable of inflicting very severe wounds. In the Hippopotamus
the canines are of enormous size, and their punishing
power is further strengthened by the fact that they
work in opposition to a pair of similar teeth in the lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>jaw; they cut like a pair of shears, the upper closing upon
the lower pair with the precision of scissors-blades. In
addition, the lower jaw develops two long, blunt-pointed,
ivory spikes, which are scarcely less to be dreaded. With
these weapons the bulls fight furiously, and it is no uncommon
thing to find vanquished males frightfully
mauled, the hide being lacerated from head to tail.
Protection, in a measure, is afforded by its enormous
thickness, but the great folds and pleats of skin seen
in the Rhinoceros are never developed. The females,
however, are similarly armed, and the teeth are nearly as
large as in the males, which is a rather unusual occurrence.</p>

<p>The Swine, which are near relations of the Hippopotamus,
in like manner develop huge pointed canines, and these
reach their maximum in the great Wart-hogs of Africa.
But in the swine the mechanism differs, for although
the canines are closely opposed, the shaft of the upper
teeth curves upwards, and the lower teeth are much
smaller than the upper. In fighting, these animals do
not bite, like the Hippopotamus, but use the upper
canines to rip up their antagonist with a sudden, swift
upward and sideways movement of the head. How
dangerous is the wound thus inflicted those who have
hunted the wild-boar know well. A curious exaggeration
of this arrangement of the teeth is seen in the Babiroussa.
Herein the upper canines grow directly upwards, actually
piercing the upper lip as in the case of the downwardly
growing tusks of the elephant. That these teeth, however,
are of any service in fighting is doubtful, for the
upper tooth curves upwards and backwards in a semicircle
so that the points are harmless. The tusks of the
lower jaw, however, are extremely long and pointed,
though their wounding power is limited by reason of
the upper teeth. This may account for the fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>the head, the part mostly attacked by enraged boars,
presents no sort of armature designed for defence; while
in the Wart-hog, on the other hand, great solid bucklers
of hide stand out on either side of the head below the
eyes, giving the animal a most repulsive appearance,
but affording him a very present help in time of trouble.
In the wild-boar, where the tusks are shorter, no such
protective armature is needed.</p>

<p>The Zebras, unlike their cloven-hoofed relations, have no weapons, save for inter-tribal
conflicts. Yet they have been as successful in holding their own against
lions and other predatory animals as species provided with horns.</p>

<p class="center">GIRAFFE.</p>

<p>The horns of this animal can prove formidable weapons of offence on occasion,
though they are useless against predatory animals.</p></div>

<p>While the ungulates, or hoofed animals, are peculiar
in the development of horns as weapons of offence, they
are by no means singular in the use of teeth for this
purpose. In some cases, as in the Muntjac, both forms
of armature are present. The only other instances where
teeth in this group of animals are used for offensive
purposes are those furnished by the Camel and the
Horse. But here they do not exhibit that excessive
size which is met with in the Elephant, and some of the
Swine. In both the Camel and the Horse it is the canine
which is used, and both jaws are similarly armed. Since
the camel has no upper incisors, the part played by the
teeth is beyond dispute; but it has been contended that
the horse uses his incisor or “front-teeth” alone when
fighting. But this is not so; the canines can, and do,
inflict ugly wounds, as is shown by the necks of zebras.</p>

<p>A further method of defence among the larger Ungulates,
at any rate, is resorted to when hard pressed: and this
is the use of the hoof in kicking. Giraffes kick both after
the usual fashion and in striking downwards with the fore-foot.
And an interesting demonstration of this has been
furnished by Mr. F. C. Selous in his delightful “African
Nature Notes.” He relates that on one occasion he came
across a calf only a day or two old, with its back broken.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
From scratches on the calf, and the footprints on the
ground in its vicinity, he was at once enabled to gather
the cause of its terrible plight. In a word, it had been
attacked by two leopards, and the mother, in an endeavour
to beat off the assailants with a blow of her fore-foot had
accidentally struck her offspring. Horses, Cattle, Antelopes,
Camels and Elephants can all kick with precision
and effect. So far as the evidence goes, however, this
is a method of defence used against beasts of prey, and is
rarely, if ever, employed in conflicts between rival males.
Females persecuted by the undesired attentions of
amorous males, however, do, as we know from the case
of domesticated animals, use this device to defend
themselves.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to account for the origin of such
secondary sexual characters as manes, beards, tusks, and
brightly-coloured areas of skin, though whether our
interpretations are really correct is another matter. But
no attempt to explain the origin of horns has yet achieved
a like degree of persuasiveness. These weapons appear
only in the Ungulates, a group which has, in past times,
given birth to some very extraordinary types of head
armature of this kind. These must be excluded from
the present discussion; suffice it to say that, as usual,
they were the adjuncts of the males. According to
current theories it is supposed that these weapons arose
as the result of the action of sexual selection. It is
assumed that the hornless ancestors of now horned
ruminants fought for their mates by “butting” with the
forehead. Naturally, other things being equal, the
thickest skulled combatants obtained the mastery. Any
tendency to develop frontal “bosses” of bone would
further enhance the chances of success, and would, indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>soon become necessary for survival. And from such
“bosses” the passage to horns and antlers forms an easy
transition. Just such incipient horns or “bosses”
actually make their appearance in the domesticated
horse: but these animals never butt at one another.
If, however, we regard horn-production as an inherent
diathesis of the ungulate somatoplasm, we have an
intelligible basis for the explanation of horn development.</p>

<p>The formidable horns of the Rhinoceros are of a totally
different character, being solid structures formed by hairlike
agglomerations, firmly fixed upon a roughened area
of the nasal region. These weapons play a very important
part in settling disputes between rival males, but on
other occasions demanding offensive tactics the Indian
Rhinoceros at any rate seems to depend rather on his
power of wounding by means of the chisel-shaped lower
incisors. These, by means of a swift lateral movement
of the head can be made to inflict most terrible gashes,
as those who hunt with elephants well know. It is quite
possible, however, that the teeth are also thus used during
struggles for supremacy. And this may perhaps account
for the enormous bucklers of skin developed by the Indian
Rhinoceros, but only indicated in the case of the African
species.</p>

<p>All the larger Ungulates, and many of the smaller
species, are polygamous. The Rhinoceros, and all of the
swine-group save the Hippopotamus, among the larger
species are exceptions to the rule. The preponderance
of females which this implies is generally supposed to be
due to the losses sustained among the males by fighting
during the struggle for mates. The case of horses, however,
seems to militate against this view, for though
they undoubtedly fight furiously, no evidence is forthcoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>to show that such conflicts terminate fatally.</p>

<p>Were it possible to secure the necessary data it would
probably be found that polygamy, and polyandry, are
determined solely by the numerical proportions of the
sexes: the excess of males or females being due neither
to “Natural” nor “Sexual” Selection, but to inherent
peculiarities of the germ-plasm tending to produce an
excess of males, or females, as the case may be.</p>

<p>Finally, all the evidence goes to show that it is a
mistake to suppose that polygamy is due to the excessive
sexual avidness of the males, which impels them to first
essay the overthrow of all possible rivals, and then to
appropriate every female within their sphere of influence,
holding them by force. On the contrary, this plurality
of mates is thrust upon them. And this because the
females, impelled by “mate-hunger,” attach themselves
to the nearest male within call: the size of the harem
depending on the number of available males. The
battles which are fought between rival males are no
more sanguinary than in the case of monogamous species.
This contention is well illustrated by the African Wydah-birds
(<i>Vidua</i>), which are markedly polygamous, though
they have no special weapons of offence. In districts
where males are numerous the harem will not exceed
eight, or ten, females; where males are scarce this
number may be increased to fifty. In like manner the
varying number of hinds accompanying a stag are to be
regarded, not as an index of his prowess, but of the
scarcity or abundance of males in the neighbourhood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br /><br />

<small><small>THE LION AND HIS KIN</small></small></h2>

<p class="indent f08">A Surprising Relationship—The Lion’s Mane—The Sabre-toothed
Tiger—Some Theories about Origins—Sea-lions in Love—Some
Strange Ornaments—Whales and Weapons.</p>

<p>That the Lion and the Lamb could possibly have been
derived from the same stock seems incredible: yet such
is the case, though the pedigree is now well-nigh lost
in the mists of a hoary antiquity. It is not surprising,
then, that in their present-day garb they should show
so little in common. Nor is it strange that among their
many points of divergence the one should differ so conspicuously
from the other in the matter of secondary
sexual characters. For when these are conspicuous
among the Ungulates they usually take the form of
horns, of which the Carnivores have no need, for the
teeth and claws whereby they win their daily portion of
meat make equally serviceable weapons of offence when
turned against their own kind.</p>

<p>Among the larger Carnivora, the Lion alone displays
any obvious distinction between the sexes in the matter
of ornament, and this in the form of the well-known
mane. Darwin, and later authorities, have regarded this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>as a shield to protect the great blood-vessels from injury
during battles between rivals. But it is not very clear
that this alone is sufficient to explain its presence, inasmuch
as the Tiger in this respect is defenceless. Mr. F. C.
Selous long ago pointed out that the varying abundance
of the mane is due to climatic causes. Lions which live in
districts where the nights are very cold, as in high table-lands,
have large manes; those which occupy lower
ground, where the nights are relatively warm, have but a
scanty mane. It is clear, however, that the abundance
of the mane is not determined by the need for warmth,
otherwise it would have been as well developed in the
female. Rather we must regard a low temperature
as conducive to the growth of long hair when a natural
tendency to produce this is present.</p>

<p>There are few men who can claim to have so great a
first-hand acquaintance with Lions as Mr. Selous, and
he has pointed out to me one significant fact which seems
to show not only that the mane has not been developed
to serve as a shield when fighting, but that fights between
rival males must be rare. And this because of the
absence of any evidence in the shape of scars on the skin.
With claws so formidable as those of the lion, ugly
wounds would certainly be made in any prolonged conflicts,
for the skin of this animal is very thin.</p>

<p>In the now extinct Sabre-toothed Tiger the upper
canines were of enormous length, and it is not improbable
that they, on this account, exceeded the bounds of usefulness;
that, while as weapons of offence they may have
proved exceedingly effective, yet they hampered the animal
when feeding. In many ways one is reminded by these
weapons of the huge tusks of the Walrus. These are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>blunt-pointed, and are said to be used very largely for
digging up the large clams and other burrowing shell-fish
on which this animal mainly feeds. They are also
used as levers to drag the huge body out of the water
on to the ice. As fighting weapons they are formidable,
and the wounds they inflict are sometimes serious. The
polygamous habits of this huge creature may account for
the fact that they are so much larger in the males,
wherein they may attain a length of thirty inches, and
a weight of eight pounds a-piece.</p>

<p>In connection with the monstrous tusks of the Sabre-toothed
Tiger there is a point which so far seems never to
have attracted the attention it deserves. And this
concerns two small flanges of bone which project from
the lower border of the end of the lower jaw. In themselves
they are unimportant: they lie, it is to be noticed,
parallel with the points of the great upper teeth which
descend on either side of them. Their full significance
is not apparent till we turn to the skull of another
extinct animal of quite another type—the huge Dinoceros,
one of the Ungulates. This animal was also armed
with an enormous pair of tusks, which also, when the
mouth was closed, descended on either side of a flange.
In this case, however, the flange was developed to such
an extent that its free edge descended to the level of
the point of the tusk, thus affording it protection against
injury. The really striking feature of this curious down-growth
is not apparent till an attempt is made to explain
its presence. What determined its growth? It seems
to furnish us with another of the many instances which
are to be found of the correlation of growth between
unrelated parts, for there is apparently no traceable
connection between the growth of this pair of teeth in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>the upper jaw and the development of the flanges of the
lower border of the jaw which are embraced by these
teeth. In the Sabre-toothed Tiger the inciting cause
to this flange growth, whatever it may have been, seems
to have been much weaker than in the case of Dinoceros.</p>

<p>Naturally one asks, can the whole thing be explained
by the theory of Kinetogenesis promulgated years ago by
Cope? That is to say, are these curious down-growths
the result of a response to a stimulus set up in the lower
jaw by constant lateral blows dealt by the tusks against
the side of the jaw during the lateral movements of the
jaw when feeding or ruminating? Such movements in an
Ungulate would be frequent and constant: hence perhaps
the more striking result. On account of the scissor-like
action of the jaws in the Sabre-tooth such lateral movements
were far less extensive, and less powerful. But
though this explanation sounds plausible, it presents
many difficulties. In the first place it seems to commit
one to the admission that the responses of the Somatoplasm
during the life of the individual are transmitted to the
germ-plasm: that, in short, the characters acquired
by the individual during its lifetime are transmitted
to its offspring. And there are insuperable difficulties in
the way of such a theory. Yet, it must be admitted,
it is no less difficult to believe that this correlation of
growth is due solely to fortuitous variation, for one
cannot really conceive of a variation of this kind taking
place in two such different structures independently. Such
a conception would have been less difficult if the case of
Dinoceros alone were known to us. We could have supposed
that, somehow, the lower jaw started to produce
its flange just as the teeth began to develop an excess of
growth which carried their points beyond the level of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>the jaw. But the Sabre-tooth shows that the tusks
had assumed a growth relatively exaggerated as in
Dinoceros, and yet the flange never attained to more than
feeble development. We cannot rest content with the
theory that the flange is due to the constant stimulus of
blows struck against this region of the jaw during the
lateral movements which take place when feeding. Were
these animals alive to-day it could be tested by extracting
the tusks during infancy, when, the stimulus being removed,
the flanges should not appear.</p>

<p>There are yet other aspects of the skull of Dinoceros
which may well be considered here. The first concerns
the excessive armature of horns, there being no less than
three pairs supported on massive bony cores; and the
second the ridiculously small brain cavity which is proportionately
smaller than that of any other known
mammal, recent or fossil. This poverty of brain-power
was probably one, if not the chief, factor among the causes
which brought about the extinction of this strange beast.
Even more formidable horns were borne by the extinct
Arsinoetherium. But this animal did not display the
double armature of horns and tusks.</p>

<p>Among the Carnivora monogamy is the rule, though
the Lion is occasionally polygamous. But the Eared-seals
(<i>Otaria</i>), or Sea-lions, and Sea-bears afford a striking
example of polygamous species and of the ferocity they
display when sexually excited. These animals, moreover,
are capable of the most astonishing powers of endurance
and vitality, exceeding indeed that of all other mammals.
Since the habits of the Northern Fur-seal (<i>Otaria ursina</i>)
have been more carefully studied than those of any others,
it may serve as a sample of the rest.</p>

<p>Living for the greater part of the year in the open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>sea, the old bulls—animals of six or seven years old—are
the first to seek the “rookeries,” or breeding grounds,
taking up their territory a full month before the cows
arrive. Later, the younger bulls appear, and the more
daring endeavour to force their way through the ranks
of those who have already taken up positions. This
often leads to fighting, but more usually nothing further
than “bluffing” is indulged in, though it is commonly
supposed that very severe engagements take place. This
seems, however, to be only occasionally true. In due
course, generally about the second week in June, the cows
begin to arrive, at first in straggling numbers, but soon
the main body puts in an appearance, and before the end
of the month many thousands of both sexes are crowded
along the foreshore. But yet, contrary to the generally accepted
belief, no serious fighting takes place. The bulls
quietly seize the females as they arrive. It would seem
that the first arrival serves as a focus of attraction for all
later comers landing in the vicinity. The bull holding
the most advantageous post—that is to say, that nearest
the best landing-place—starts the collection and, unintentionally,
the distribution of the cows. Having seized
the first arrival, he places her by his side. As the later
females arrive he gives each a most cordial welcome, and
then proceeds to round up his harem. But soon he has
more wives than he can continue to control. Do what
he will, he cannot be in two places at once; and thus it
is that in rushing off to chastise some covetous neighbour,
one or more bulls on the opposite side of his harem proceed
to make captures from his horde. And this system
of abduction goes on over the whole rookery till all the
cows have been appropriated, leaving a crowd of envious
bachelors in the background who have not yet developed
either courage or strength to secure mates for themselves.</p>

<p>The “bulls” of the Eared Seal are much larger than the “cows”; they have
otherwise no very conspicuous “Secondary Sexual Characters.”</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 82.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>But within forty-eight hours of their landing the cows
give birth to their “pups.” And it is for this purpose,
and not for mating, that they come to land. Within a
few days of the birth, however, the females are “in use”
again. This is the critical period in the life in the rookery.
For the bulls now become frenzied with excitement and
fight most viciously one with another, each hoping to
possess himself of his opponent’s harem. Each tries to
seize the other by the fore flipper, and, failing in this,
the fangs are buried in the back. They hold tenaciously,
each trying to force the other to relax his hold; but
commonly this vice-like grip is maintained till the skin
gives way, leaving great bleeding rents. Sometimes the
contest rages till one or both is fatally wounded. Often
during such duels an idle bull, hitherto unable to secure
a harem, will rush in and capture that of one of the
combatants!</p>

<p>In the management of the harem the bull is an adept.
Whether he has five cows or fifty, he is, says Dr. Lucas,
“master of the situation.” His will is law. Not that
it is always tamely accepted as such, but the result is
the same. If a cow becomes restless, and moves about,
a warning growl usually quiets her. If the movement is
persisted in and an attempt to escape evident, the bull
is up at once with a show of fierceness and in chase. He
may simply strike her down with his open mouth. Often
in doing so his sharp canines tear a gash in her skin. He
may even seize her in his mouth and deliberately throw
her, or carry her back into the harem. If the cow thinks
she has a chance to get away she may try to outrun him.
If she miscalculates the distance he seizes her, after a
few swift bounds, by the skin of the back, or by the hind
flipper, and tosses her, often torn and bleeding, into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>family circle. As a rule, however, she avoids this seizure
by turning and facing her lord and master, and biting him
in the breast and throat. But all to no purpose. In spite
of her violent protests he pushes her backwards before him
into the fold.</p>

<p>Sometimes in her efforts to improve her position she runs
up to, and is seized by, a rival bull. Her lord speedily
asserts his ownership by getting a grip wherever he can
on the would-be truant. Then begins a tug-of-war
between the two bulls, during which the wretched victim
of their rage may be torn in pieces. By the elimination
in each generation of the more querulous and discontented,
the peculiarly gentle and passive nature so
characteristic of the females has been developed.</p>

<p>After the first ten days’ sojourn ashore the female is
allowed to go to sea to feed, returning presently to suckle
her young. The bull, on the other hand, can enjoy no
such privilege. For three long months he must keep watch
and ward fasting—at first, in order that he may retain
his territory; later, that he may retain his harem. This
fast, having regard to the loss of energy and blood which
this strenuous period entails, is wonderful; for in the case
of all other animals fasts are always associated with
absolute rest and sleep. Not so with the Sea-lion; he
arrives at the breeding-ground fat and well-liking, he
leaves a starved and battered wreck.</p>

<p>The foregoing summary of the habits of these most
interesting and much persecuted animals is taken from
the exhaustive report of Dr. F. A. Lucas and Mr. Charles
Townsend. These two distinguished naturalists accompanied
the United States contingent of the Fur-seal
International Commission despatched in 1896–97 to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>inquire into the threatened extermination of these
animals. Major Barrett Hamilton accompanied the British
contingent, and also made a report. And it is curious
to note that on some points he is diametrically opposed,
not only to the American naturalists, but to all other
writers on this theme. He contends, for example, that
“nothing could better illustrate the fact that it is the
cows, and not the bulls, which have the real control of
the harem-system.” He traced the rapid growth of two
harems from four or five to as many as eighty cows. And
he tells these were completely out of control and free
to move about as they wished. “The bulls, in spite of all
their bluster, had the flimsiest of nominal dominion, and
the cows were always able to, and frequently did, leave
the harems daily to dally with the cowless bulls on the
outside. Yet ... as long as they chose to sit massed
together on the ground which had been appropriated by
the two stronger bulls, no weaker rivals could approach
to within ten yards of them. The master of the harem
had no control over its occupants, but he was absolute
lord of the ground on which they sat.” This is certainly
curious, but more so is the fact that these females were
allowed to return by the “cowless bulls” outside the
charmed circle. Later in the season he tells us he witnessed
an even better illustration of this singular behaviour.
At this time “the division of the cows into
harems was a very unequal one, the smaller bull being
only able to keep a very few cows, while the larger one
claimed the greater part of the rookery. But the cows
could pass over to the smaller bull’s ground as often as
they liked; and he probably was father to a great many
more of the pups born in 1898 than those of the half-dozen
cows over whom he claimed control.” In regard to two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>other bulls in another cart of the island, there came a
time when the inequality of the harems reached such a
pitch, that the newly-arriving cows “had to lie in scattered
groups outside the main mass, and thus permitted the
weaker bulls to form new harems out of the reach of the
two strong old bulls.” But perhaps the most singular
feature of all was the indifference which one old bull
displayed towards a little bachelor, permitting him to
enjoy the most intimate relations with one of his cows
without displaying the least sign of annoyance, as if he
could scarcely regard one so young as a rival.</p>

<p>There is much evidence to show that the erotic side of
the male-seal develops early. “I saw,” he says, “the
little black pups acting to each other in a way that made
it certain that their sexual feelings had already made
themselves felt.” This one can well understand, for only
animals of strong sexual tendencies could survive the
strenuous life which the period of sexual activity entails.</p>

<p>The very different interpretation of the behaviour
of these animals at this very important stage of their life-history
must be due to the fact that different colonies
were studied which were living, too, under somewhat
different conditions. It seems clear, for example, that
the landing of the females so graphically described by
Dr. Lucas was a landing under exceptional circumstances,
the master bulls having taken up positions at the only
spot where access to the desired breeding quarters was
to be found; while Major Barrett Hamilton was probably
fortunate in seeing phases which were wanting in the
“rookeries” examined by Dr. Lucas. And both these
observers again differ in the accounts they give of the
life of such “rookeries” with those by Mr. Elliot, who
explored these teeming colonies some years earlier when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>the number of animals forgathered there was far larger
and the fighting, apparently in consequence, was far more
severe.</p>

<p>In the matter of secondary sexual characters the most
remarkable of the seal-tribe are those of the Elephant Seal
and the Bladder-nosed Seal, and this because of the extraordinary
development of inflatable tissue above the muzzle
which these animals display. Of their life-history we
know little enough, and this despite the fact that for
generations the Elephant Seal was mercilessly hunted
and slain for the sake of its oil. Millions were slaughtered
during the last century, yet only scraps of information on
the economy of the creatures has come down to us. All
that is of any value, and especially in regard to the “Courting”
period, we owe to Mr. Charles Townsend, of the New
York Aquarium, and this in regard to the northern species,
<i>Macrorhinus angustirostris</i> of Guadelupe, though it may
safely be inferred that the Southern, Antarctic species,
<i>M. leoninus</i>, differs in no essential respects.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Townsend, the adult bull, having taken
possession of his territory and formed a harem, is constantly
called upon to wage duels for both with less fortunate
rivals. And the severity of such combats was attested
by the deep wounds and festering sores of the necks of
these old warriors—which, at their maximum, attained
in the days of their prosperity a length of nearly thirty
feet and a girth of sixteen feet; but the last survivors of
the race to-day seem rarely to exceed twenty-two feet.
The weapons used in fighting are the canines, and the only
armour they possess is that formed by the thickening of
the skin of the neck, which forms a great massive shield,
so that really dangerous wounds are rare. The great
fleshy proboscis, the most vulnerable part, is carefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>guarded by the upturned position of the head. The use
of this trunk-like organ, which may attain a length of
about fifteen inches, is not clear; it seems to serve mainly
as an “ornament,” at times, too, furnishing a very definite
indication as to the temper of its owner. While the
animal is slowly moving its great carcase from place to
place, this remarkable organ is relaxed, and pendent;
but when fighting it is closely contracted so as to be out
of harm’s way. Whether it plays any useful part in the
capture of food is not known; but it is probably much
displayed during phases of sexual excitement. In young
animals, it is significant to notice, as well as in the adult
female this trunk is entirely wanting, which seems to
suggest that this peculiar feature has only been recently
acquired, the young and the adult female, as is the rule,
standing nearer to the early forebears of this strange type.
There is an enormous difference, it should be remarked,
between the sexes in the matter of size, the female not
attaining more than half the bulk of her lord. A further
interesting point concerns the coloration of the young,
which are black, while the adults are brown. Doubtless
this is connected with the requirements of the young, the
black coat attracting more heat than the lighter-coloured
coat of the adult.</p>

<p>As touching that curious creature, the Crested, or
Hooded Seal (<i>Cystophora cristatus</i>), a native of the colder
regions of the North Atlantic. This animal is remarkable
for the development, in the males alone, of a great
crest or casque on the head, which is formed by a large
inflatable air-sac over the ridge of the nose, and communicating
with the nostrils. When fully inflated, it
covers the head as far back as the eye. Its purpose is a
matter of conjecture. It seems to be inflated either when
he animal is greatly excited, as when challenging rival
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>males, or when threatened with danger from other causes,
as when attacked by man. The males are exceedingly
pugnacious, and fight with one another for the possession
of females with great ferocity, such contests being accompanied
by cries which can be heard for miles. From the
difficulty which Esquimaux and sealers find in killing the
animal with clubs it certainly seems as if this strange
wind-bag were more than merely ornamental.</p>

<p>That those extraordinary creatures the Cetacea—the
Whales and their kin—are derived from the same common
stock as the typical carnivora there can nowadays be
no doubt, widely as they have departed from their land-dwelling
relatives in almost every possible feature of their
organization. In the matter of their “Courtship” we
know nothing, but we may infer certain incidents in this
critical period of their life-history from the peculiar nature
of the secondary sexual characters which some species
display. Thus in the Pilot Whale (<i>Globicephalus</i>) and the
Bottle-nose Whale (<i>Hyperoödon</i>) the forehead, in the bulls,
is enormously swollen by a mass of fibrous tissue so dense
as to turn the blade of the sharpest knife, as I know well
from attempts to dissect this region. Now the only use,
surely, for such a cushion is that of a battering-ram
by rival males in charging one another, as rams and other
horned animals will do. In the Bottle-nose Whale this
cushion is backed up by an enormous mass of solid bone
thrown up by the maxillæ. The origin of this bony
growth is interesting, for it appears first as a slight swelling
in the rare species <i>Berardius</i>; it is seen at a further
stage of growth in the female “Bottle-nose” (<i>Hyperoödon</i>),
and attains its maximum in the male, where it stands
unique. There are two other species which demand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>notice here. The first is Layard’s Beaked Whale
(<i>Mesoplodon</i>); the second the Narwhal. The former is the
only vertebrate which in a wild state wears a muzzle!
In this species the teeth have totally vanished save for a
pair in the lower jaw, which are found towards the end
of the jaw. These in the adult, or perhaps we should say
senile, male grow upwards and inwards, finally meeting
one another above the upper jaw, so as to make it impossible
for the animal to open its mouth more than the
fraction of an inch! Surely here we have a secondary
sexual character carried to an excess, and so proving not
only disadvantageous to the animal, but positively
disastrous, for it seems clear that so hampered the creature
can feed only on the most minute forms of animal life,
which could only be captured and swallowed with difficulty.
It is true that the Rorquals feed on excessively minute
Crustacea, but they are able to take in enormous quantities
at a time, the “whalebone” serving the office of a sieve
to prevent their escape. The Mesoplodon has no such
aids. One is tempted to believe that the skulls displaying
this most curious feature are abnormal, comparable to
those, say, of rabbits wherein the teeth have grown so
excessively long as to close the mouth, on account of the
displacement of the cutting surfaces by accident. But
there is nothing to afford support to this view, and one
must therefore fall back on the suggestion of senility.</p>

<p>The Narwhal has long been celebrated for the enormous
size of the canine teeth, the only teeth present in the jaws.
As a rule, only one leaves its bony socket, the other,
commonly the right, remaining as a mere vestige, seven
or eight inches long within the skull. The protruding
tooth, which is spirally fluted, may attain a length of nine
feet. Occasionally both teeth are developed, and in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>case the spiral is the same, differing in a very striking
manner from the spiral horns of ruminants, wherein one
presents a right, the other left-handed spiral. But what
purpose do these teeth serve? This question has never
yet been definitely settled. Some hold that it is used to
break open breathing holes in the ice, for the animal lives
in the far north: others that it is used as a spear in
hunting prey. Some aver that it serves as a weapon of
offence, being used by rival males in their struggle for
mates. Scoresby, the explorer, indeed, says he has seen
young males in mock-battle, fencing with these remarkable
weapons. But until we have more satisfactory data,
we must regard this armature of the Narwhal as affording
another instance of a secondary sexual character of doubtful
value to its possessor.</p>

<p>The fact that so little is known about the mammals
during that period when the all-important work of securing
mates is going on, and of the subsequent events, is largely
due to the difficulties which close observation of this phase
of their life-history entails. With the birds matters are
far otherwise; their haunts are more accessible; they are
far more numerous, and much more easily kept under
observation. Consequently, we have a tolerably complete
knowledge of the lives of some species, at any rate, during
the reproductive period; that is to say, as to the sequence
of events from the beginning of the reproductive activities
onwards; but the interpretation of what is seen is another
matter. No attempt which has yet been made to fathom
the psychology of sex has yielded more than a slight
insight into what is taking place. Nevertheless, this is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>an aspect of the subject which has a far more important
bearing on the problems of evolution than is generally
realized. But these pages are concerned rather with the
relations between the sexes, than with the subtle forces
which have fashioned and control conduct in this regard.</p>

<p>In all that concerns the problems of sex, which is to
say of reproduction, birds, speaking generally, display
a briefer and more condensed sequence of events than
the mammals; and, moreover, many species compel the
attention even of the most incurious, to their behaviour
at this time, through the development, either of song, or
of fantastic displays of their amorous feelings: while others
force themselves no less conspicuously under notice by
their habit of nesting in large, and often enormous colonies.</p>

<p>In the matter of the development of secondary sexual
characters birds stand conspicuous among the Vertebrates,
and easily eclipse the mammals; among which bright,
strongly contrasted, colours are the exception. Among
the birds they may almost be said to be the rule. Also,
in this category we have to reckon song, and the production
of more or less musical sounds by the agency of
internal resonators or of specially modified feathers;
as well as quaint forms of posturing which may be
included under the head of dances. Further, some species
have developed formidable weapons of offence. These
things are interesting enough in themselves, but they
become still more so when we reflect that they formed
the corner-stone of Darwin’s theory of “Sexual Selection,”
and that Wallace’s criticisms thereof were inspired by
evidence from the same source.</p>

<p>The interests of this chapter will best be served if the
evidence on which this theory was founded be first surveyed:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>when Darwin’s deductions and the criticism
which they have aroused will be the more readily
appreciated.</p>

<p>Definitions are always liable to exceptions; and concrete
cases are better than abstract terms. Birds, then,
perhaps better than any other group, illustrate what is
meant by the term “secondary sexual characters,”
if only because examples are so constantly at hand. Save
among experts, sex among birds cannot be determined
except by the differences in plumage, or sometimes in
size, which the sexes display. But even here, it is only
among species which occupy what we may call a mid-evolutionary
phase in which this discrimination is
possible. Among “generalized” species, wherein the
plumage is of sombre hue, there is no external distinguishing
mark between male and female; and the
same is true with species which have attained to the
maximum of resplendent plumage; as for example many
Parrots and Kingfishers, where again both sexes, and at
all ages, display the same vivid hues. Thus, in the case
of either of the two extremes, the study of behaviour
during the breeding season is one of great difficulty and
no less uncertainty. Where the sexes are sharply distinguished
by differences of coloration, however, as with
the Peacock, the matter is otherwise. This bird, from
time immemorial the symbol of vanity, illustrates in a
singularly effective manner the broad features of what
is commonly meant by “courtship” among birds, while
it furnishes a no less striking example of the development
of “secondary sexual characters.”</p>

<p>One might have supposed that birds, under the spell
of that irresistible desire for sexual intercourse, would
behave differently in regard to their “courtship” according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>to whether they were monogamous, polygamous, or
polyandrous: but while their behaviour during this period
of the life-history presents an extraordinary variety, it
is only at any rate slightly determined by the plurality
or otherwise of mates; and the same rule holds in regard
to the brilliancy or otherwise of coloration.</p>

<p>The most common manifestation of sexual desire among
birds takes the form of strange posturings which are, in
some species, enormously exaggerated by the display of
vividly coloured frills, tufts, or other conspicuous modifications
of the normal plumage. The Peacock affords a
most excellent example of this combination of the contortionist
and the beau, though the nature of this display
is by no means generally understood. This applies more
particularly to artists, who from time immemorial to
the present day, in essaying to paint the Peacock in his
pride, have invariably fallen into the error of treating
the great ocellated train as if it were the tail, placing
it where, of course, the tail ought to be, at the end of
the body! As a matter of fact it is nothing of the kind;
these gorgeous plumes are really exaggerated tail-coverts
which, when set on end, appear to arise from an oval shield
of metallic green scales—the central back-feathers. When
this trailing glory is erected, the bird throws the body
forwards and downwards, so that the outermost train-feathers
fall downwards on either side in front of the
wings, which are more or less trailed: so that from the
front only the head and neck are visible, the rest of the
body being hidden <i>behind</i> the screen, as may be seen by a
reference to the accompanying photographs. The manner
of this display is extremely interesting, for the bird seems
to be conscious of the effect produced: though it cannot
be supposed that this is really the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>When displaying, the bird gradually approaches the
nearest female and slowly erects these extraordinary
plumes. So soon as this is accomplished he begins to
walk backwards towards the object of his attentions,
presenting nothing but a great round shield of dull brown
feathers, backed up by the tail-feathers, and the dull-coloured
wings. So soon as he judges himself near enough,
however, he suddenly swirls round, confronting her in all
his splendour, and heightening the effect with a loud scream
accompanied by a rapid, vibratory, motion of the train-feathers
which produces sounds like the pattering of rain
on leaves. Then he stands before her, with bowed head,
as if to give her an opportunity of drinking in his splendour
to the full. Commonly, however, she appears to be
utterly indifferent, and either walks away or continues a
real, or affected hunt for food, as if no such thing as a
love-sick suitor were within a hundred miles of her! But
sooner or later his suggestive attitudes beget an answering
response, and pairing takes place.</p>

<p>The display of the beautiful Peacock Pheasant differs
conspicuously from that of the Peacock, and recalls that
of the Argus Pheasant. In the Peacock Pheasant, as
will be seen from the adjoining photograph, the wings, and
tail, are alike bedecked with ocelli. The display is made
by the bird as it crouches close to the ground, with the
wings and tail raised to form a continuous, patterned
surface, the head being swiftly moved during the performance;
hence its blurred outline in the photograph.</p>

<p class="center">PEACOCK PHEASANT.</p>

<p>The display of this bird differs conspicuously from that of the Peacock and recalls that of the
Pigeon in some respects. The “ocelli” on the wings afforded Darwin the interpretation he sought
for as to the meaning of the notch in the “eye” of the Peacock’s tail-feather.</p>

the neck; the lower figure shows the train supported by the tail and dropping on each

<p>The Argus Pheasant is an even more wonderful performer
than the two preceding species. In this bird, it
should be remarked, the tail and the secondary wing-feathers
are enormously lengthened, the latter to an extent
met with in no other bird, showing that the struggle for
existence cannot be very severe with this species. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>if long journeys had to be undertaken in search of food,
or to avoid extremes of climate, or enemies had to be
swiftly escaped, such cumbersome wings would lead
to speedy extermination. But an even more remarkable
feature of these wings is their wonderful coloration.
The primaries have blue shafts, and a most delicately
mottled pattern formed by spots of reddish chocolate
on cream-coloured ground, while the secondaries have
their broad webs ornamented with large ocelli, to be
described in greater detail presently. When under the
influence of sexual excitement Darwin tells us, the wings
are so spread as to form a deep concavity, an effect which
is gained by pressing the primaries close to the ground,
and turning the elbows upwards. Within this concavity lie
the ocelli, in radiating vertical rows. But to produce this
effect the bird has to turn its head under its wing, so that
it lies behind the screen. Hence it cannot see the female
which is the object of these captivating antics. As a
consequence, to discover whether he has an audience for
she will often walk disdainfully away—he has constantly
to thrust his head through the curtain, and hence many
of the feathers in this region get much worn.</p>

<p>By nature it would seem the Argus Pheasant is a very
solitary bird, though we must assume it is polygamous.
As the breeding season advances, however, the male
proceeds to choose some open space in the depths of the
forest—which it never leaves—and therefrom to clear
all the dead leaves, and twigs, for a space of some six
or eight yards square, so that nothing but the bare earth
remains, and thereafter this area is kept scrupulously
clean. Here, in solitary state, for a short season he
remains, calling at frequent intervals to advertise the fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>that an eligible male is in the neighbourhood desiring
mates. A dozen times in succession he will break the
stillness of the forest gloom with a loud, “How-how, how,
how, how!” Sooner or later comes a responsive, “How-owoo,
how-owoo!” and in a short time, guided by the
sound, one or more females discover the object of their
quest. But the pairing desire has not yet reached its
full intensity, and doubtless to kindle this the display just
described is enacted, and not once, but a dozen times
probably, before the desired state of frenzy has been
aroused. Not seldom another male answers the cry,
and this inevitably leads to a duel whereby the fittest
and strongest male is speedily discovered.</p>

<p>A word as to these ocelli. This pattern is rare among
birds, and Darwin brought to light some extremely
interesting facts regarding it. He was led to investigate
the matter by his curiosity as to the meaning of the notch
in the ocelli of the Peacock’s train-feathers. At last he
noticed that among the different species of Peacock
Pheasants there was one (<i>Polyplectron chinquis</i>), in which
the ocelli were paired, one lying on either side of the
shaft, in another (<i>P. malaccense</i>) these approached
and partly fused with one another. Now, to get the
indented ocellus of the Peacock, we have only to imagine
the fusion of two such ocelli, whose long axes inclined
obliquely to one another, to get the “eye” of the Peacock
with its indented lower edge; for such fusion would give
a continuous upper and an indented lower border.</p>

<p>The “eyes” of the Argus Pheasant are more interesting
still, for, as Darwin pointed out, these have the appearance,
if the feathers are held more or less vertically, of a number
of balls lying each within a socket, or cup: for each of
these balls has a light area which exactly simulates the
light glancing across the upper pole of a sphere, leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>the rest in shadow; and, singularly enough, this effect
is produced in the living bird only when the feathers are
erected for display. The probable steps in the evolution
of these ocelli from simple spots, and through elliptical
bars, Darwin traced with his usual skill and insight, and
those who would follow this up should turn to that
wonderful book, “The Descent of Man.”</p>

<p class="center">PATTERNS WHICH PUZZLED DARWIN.</p>

<p>The notch in the “eyes” of the Peacock’s train-feathers puzzled
Darwin till he met with the ocelli of the Peacock-pheasant. The
left-hand lower figure represents the ocellus of the Argus, the right-hand
that of the Peacock-pheasant.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 98.</p></div>

<p>It is probable that the erroneous interpretation of the
display of the Peacock is due to the more lasting and
easily remembered impression of what obtains in the case
of the Turkey under like emotions. This bird in his
exultant moods, most people have seen. Herein the
tail plays a very important part, being raised and spread
to form a great half-circle, while at the same time the
back-feathers, or at least those of the lower back, are set
on end, and the wings are trailed on the ground. The
effect is heightened by the suffusion of blood to the bare
skin of the head and neck, and the sudden inflation of a
long, pendent, fleshy wattle from the forehead, which hangs
down over the beak. Great display is made with this,
and an additional importance is added by the spasmodic
vocal efforts which can best be described by the “gobble”
rapidly repeated, as the bird struts about with mincing
gait, turning the wheel-like tail now to one side now to
the other. But the Turkey possesses yet another “ornament”
which commonly escapes notice. This is the
curious tuft of long, black, coarse, bristles which projects
forward in front of the breast. It is difficult to discern
what part this tuft may play, since it is quite
inconspicuous. It seems as though this must be added
to the number of structural characters which appear
to survive without any apparent use.</p>

<p>The game-birds, it is significant to remark—and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>significant because they are commonly polygamous—afford
a quite remarkable series of displays, only some of which
can be summarized in these pages. In every case, too,
they are accompanied by conspicuous coloration and a
more or less excessive development of brightly-coloured
plumes, or areas of bare skin. In some, as in those
wonderful birds the Tragopans, the development of bare
skin, vividly coloured, and produced into pendulous folds,
has attained a degree met with nowhere else among this
group. These flaps, or finger-like wattles, as the case may
be, under the influence of sexual excitement become
turgid, and their hues enormously intensified: though
beyond this fact but little else is known of their performances.
In Swinhoe’s Pheasant the face is bare, the
skin being covered, as in the case of the common Pheasant,
with tiny villi of a vivid red colour. But when excited
by the presence of a female the upper part of this face
area rises high above the head like a pair of horns. With
these turgid, and erect, the bird makes a series of
short, semicircular rushes around his prospective mate,
accompanying each of these gyrations with an angry
hissing sound. The Golden, and Amherst Pheasants
are among the most gorgeously clad of birds. Not their
least conspicuous ornament is a cape-like frill of long,
highly coloured feathers of which the birds seem to be
extremely conscious; for when endeavouring to excite
the female nearest him to the necessary pitch of sexual
desire, he places himself sideways before her, drawing
the frill round to the side facing her, and dropping the
wing, in order, as it would seem, that she may miss
nothing of his resplendent livery. This side of his nature
he reserves for her. Intruding rivals are treated after
quite another fashion, for like most of the gallinaceous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>birds his legs are armed with formidable spurs which
can, and do, inflict the most terrible wounds: as, indeed,
has been shown from the evidence of the Cock-pit in the
case of game-cocks.</p>

<p class="center">THE “STRUTTING TURKEY.”</p>

<p>This should be contrasted with the Peacock. Herein the tail itself is the principal
ornament, the effect of which is heightened by the erection of the back-feathers, and
the vivid play of colour of the “wattles” of the head.</p></div>

<p class="center">THE DISPLAY OF THE GREAT BUSTARD.</p>

<p>This is effected by the inflation of a great wind-bag in the neck, and the eversion
of the wing and tail feathers as described in the text.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 100.</p></div>

<p>By way of contrast with the several displays just
described, it would be hard to find a more striking illustration
than that afforded by the Lesser Bird of Paradise
(<i>Paradisea minor</i>), inasmuch as here the display is
associated with rivalry between a number of individuals.
For much of our knowledge on this subject we have to
depend on the descriptions of natives; but happily this
has now been supplemented by observations made by
Mr. Ogilvie Grant on a captive in the Gardens of the
Zoological Society of London.</p>

<p>Impelled by the surging wave of sexual desire, as yet
only seeking consummation, these birds gather together at
frequent intervals, on certain of the forest trees of the Aru
Islands, selected apparently because they present an immense
head of spreading branches, and large but scattered
leaves. Here ample space is found for the revels, which
take the form of “Sacaleli,” or dancing-parties, comparable
to the erotic dances of many barbaric races.</p>

<p>By the time the ball opens, the birds, to the number
of twenty or more, have worked themselves up into a
state bordering on frenzy, and each commences his performance
with quivering wings and loud, penetrating
cries which may be syllabled as <i>walk—walk—walk—walk—walk—walk</i>,
rapidly repeated. Then the wings are suddenly
held out on either side, the tail is bent forward under
the branch, and with a quick, barely perceptible rustle,
the gorgeous, golden, diaphanous side-plumes are thrust
upward and forward on each side of the body, forming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>an arched cascade above the back. With every muscle
tense the performer will remain in this attitude from
ten to twenty seconds, slightly quivering the wings, and
from time to time imparting a tremor to the upraised
plumes. Then follows a second phase. Each bird,
seemingly possessed, commences to dance and hop wildly
backwards and forwards along the bough, and with head
bent forward, wings spread horizontally, and the side
plumes raised to their utmost, he gives vent to a series
of loud harsh cries—“ca! ca! ca! ca!” For some
seconds he remains in a sort of ecstasy, rubbing his beak
on the bough, and occasionally glancing backwards below
his feet, and with the back fully arched. The climax
passed, he reverts once more to the earlier, more erect
stage of the display, when the paroxysm either gradually
subsides or is renewed.</p>

<p>No less extraordinary is the behaviour of the King-bird
of Paradise (<i>Cicinnurus regius</i>), which has been
described by Sir William Ingram, who for a time had a
captive in his aviaries. As the illustration shows, its
posturing is quite remarkable. Before this is described,
however, a brief description of its coloration should be
given, which, it must be remarked, cannot possibly
convey more than a very vague idea of its sumptuous
character. Picture a bird no bigger than a thrush, but
of a wonderful cinnabar red, with a gloss as of spun
glass: the head clothed in short, velvety, orange-hued
feathers; and with a white breast, having the softness
and sheen of satin, and crossed by a band of deep metallic
green, contrasting with the red of the throat. Add a yellow
beak, and legs of cobalt blue, and you will have the features
which catch the eye at the first glance. But a little closer
examination will reveal yet other points for wonderment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>Along each side of the body the upper flank-feathers
become elongated and delicately tinted, and, furthermore,
they are erectile: so that they can be raised up on
each side of the body to form an almost circular shield
of delicate ash grey, bordered with buff and emerald
green. These play a most important part during the sexual
frenzy, and the effect thereof is not a little heightened
by the middle pair of tail-feathers, which have been
modified to form a pair of slender stalks, some ten inches
long, bearing at the ends a curious disc of emerald green
formed by coiling upon itself—like a watch-spring—the
only piece of the vane of the feather which remains.</p>

<p>So much for its fine feathers; now for the manner
of their use. “He always commences his display,”
writes Sir William Ingram, “by giving forth several short
notes and squeaks, sometimes resembling the call of a
quail, sometimes the whine of a pet dog. Next he spreads
out his wings, occasionally quite hiding his head; at
times, stretched upright, he flaps them, as if he intended
to take flight, and then, with a sudden movement, gives
himself a half turn, so that he faces the spectators, puffing
out his silky-white lower feathers; now he bursts into his
beautiful melodious warbling song, so enchanting to
hear but so difficult to describe. Some weeks ago I was
crossing a meadow and heard the song of a skylark high
up in the heavens, and I exclaimed at once: ‘That is
the love-chant of my King-bird.’ He sings a low bubbling
note, displaying all the while his beautiful fan-like side-plumes,
which he opens and closes in time with the variations
of his song. These fan-plumes can only be expanded
when his wings are closed, and during this part of the
display he closes his wings and spreads out his short tail,
pressing it close over his back, so as to throw the long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>tail-wires over his head, while he gently swings his body
from side to side. The spiral tips of the wires look like
small balls of burnished green metal, and the swaying
movement gives them the effect of being slowly tossed
from one side to the other, so that I have named this
part of the display the ‘Juggling.’ The swaying of the
body seems to keep time with the song, and at intervals,
with a swallowing movement of his throat, the bird raises
and lowers his head. Then comes the finale, which lasts
only a few seconds. He suddenly turns right round
and shows his back, the white fluffy feathers under the
tail bristling in his excitement; he bends down on the
perch in the attitude of a fighting cock, his widely-opened
bill showing distinctly the extraordinary light apple-green
colour of the inside of the mouth, and sings the same
gurgling notes without once closing his bill, and with a
slow dying-away movement of his tail and body. A
single drawn-out note is then uttered, the tail and wires
are lowered, and the dance and song are over.</p>

<p>“The King-bird has another form of display which he
very rarely exhibits, and only on three or four occasions
have I seen him go through this performance. Dropping
under the perch, the bird walks backwards and forwards
in an inverted position with his wings expanded. Suddenly
he closes his wings and lets his body fall straight
downwards, looking exactly like a crimson pear, his blue
legs being stretched out to the full length and his feet
clinging to the perch. The effect is very curious and
weird, and the performance is so like that of an acrobat
suddenly dropping on to his toes on the cross-bar of a
trapeze that I have named this the ‘Acrobatic’ display.
It has been witnessed on different days to his ‘Juggling’
display. While giving his ‘Acrobatic’ performance he
sings the whole time, but never shows his side-plumes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>and when he is in the pendulous position his body sways
gently as if it were influenced by a fitful breeze. The whole
of this performance takes but a very few seconds.”</p>

<p class="center">SOME OF FORTUNE’S FAVOURITES.</p>

<p>The Birds-of-Paradise have few rivals in the matter of ornament. In the centre of this
plate are seen the Lesser and the King Bird-of-Paradise displaying (after G. E. Lodge). The
first-named is distinguished by the enormous development of the side plumes, which can
be raised high above the back. In the second, the ornaments take the form of erectile
frills on each side of the breast, and strangely modified tail-feathers which end in curious
discs. At the top left-hand corner is the King of Saxony’s Bird-of-Paradise; on the right
is the Long-tailed Bird-of-Paradise; at the bottom of the page, from left to right, are
Hunstein’s, the Six-wired, and Superb Bird-of-Paradise.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 104.</p></div>

<p>Naturally one needs to witness such a display to appreciate
its beauty and its weirdness; but the wonderful
sketches which my friend, Mr. G. E. Lodge, made during
one of these performances, should go far towards helping
the reader to visualize what really takes place.</p>

<p>While it would be untrue to say that the Birds of Paradise
are of a more amorous, or more excitable disposition
than other less resplendent birds, one cannot but be
impressed with the fact that they exhibit a range of
variation in the matter of feather-ornament probably
unequalled, and certainly unsurpassed, by any other
group of birds. From what has been observed of the
few species which have been kept in confinement, they
seem to enjoy no less distinction in matters of display.
On this latter subject no more of importance can be said,
and exigencies of space forbid any attempt to describe the
exquisite beauty of coloration which a survey of all the
known species reveals. It would be hardly more profitable
to attempt to describe the varied character of the
shields, crests, frills, streamers, which are to be met with
in different species: but a glance at the accompanying
illustrations will show that it would be hard, indeed, to
exaggerate the splendour of the ornamentation which
these birds have developed. Even here, where no indication
can be given of the glowing, vivid colours, often
indescribably beautiful, it is obvious that these birds well
deserve their name. St. John’s imaginary Paradise would
probably have been described in far more enticing language
had he known of the existence of these wonderful birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>Among all the known species the dullest is Wallace’s
Bird of Paradise, the general coloration being of a dull
brown hue; but even here, a pair of wing-coverts are
produced into long, broad streamers, unique among birds;
while the feathers of the throat and flanks are of a marvellous
metallic green, the flank-feathers being produced
to form a long, pointed tuft.</p>

<p>To what factors must we attribute the growth of these
wonderful colours, these strange outgrowths, frills, and
tufts, and streamers, the like of which is almost unparalleled?
In a group numbering some fifty or more
species there is not one that does not display some strange
feature. We cannot attribute it to the environment, for
in such case the results should have produced uniformity;
nor can we invoke the aid of sexual selection save in a
very indirect manner, and in a sense other than generally
understood by this term. It seems, then, not unreasonable
to suggest that they are the expression points of the
internal metabolism: the manifestations of that tendency
to vary which is inherent in every fibre of the organism.
But no attempt shall be made to elaborate this theory till
more evidence has been taken. The humming-birds, and
the game-birds, are perhaps the only other groups which
exhibit quite such a prodigality of ornament; of the
latter, instances have already been cited.</p>

<p>So far the displays which have been described have been
such as are confined to the use of more or less resplendent
plumage. There are, however, many species which
contrive to secure most startling results, not so much by
the parade of coats of many colours as by grotesque changes
of shape produced by wind-bags of various kinds. The
Pouter-pigeon affords a case in point. This bird possesses
the power of inflating the gullet to an enormous size, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>as to produce a strangely distorted form, at any rate,
to our eyes. The “Pouter,” it is hardly necessary to
mention, is an artificial product of the “fancier,” who
has taken advantage of the natural tendency, seen in the
Wild Pigeon, to inflate the neck during moments of excitement.
By the selection from each generation of the
finest performers in his stock, the Pouter of to-day has
been developed. But there are many birds which,
while not even remotely related, have developed the same
strange device. The most striking illustration of this
kind is furnished by the Great Bustard, a bird once common
on the fen-lands of Great Britain, but now, unhappily,
exterminated within these islands.</p>

<p>The means of inflation in this case is afforded by a
large thin-walled sac of a very remarkable character.
Opening by a small slit just under the tongue, it is continued
down the front of the neck immediately under the
skin, which in this region is thickened by an accumulation
of fat and blood-vessels. Between the arms of the
furcula, or merry-thought, its cavity is constricted, to
expand again immediately to form a pear-shaped termination.
How it is filled is something of a mystery.
But once inflated, the bird draws its neck downwards and
backwards, so that the head is brought to rest between
the shoulders and is there almost buried, partly by pressure
on this curious air-cushion and partly by the erection of
a number of bristle-like feathers, which in calmer moments
project backwards on each side of the head. At the
same time the tail is drawn forwards to lie upon the back,
thus exposing a billowy mass of white feathers forming
the under tail-coverts. The tips of the wing-feathers are
used to hold the tail in position. Meanwhile the scapulars
are set on end, and the long inner secondary quills are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>similarly erected. The feathered contortionist, having
completed his preparations, now approaches his partner
with a mincing gait, then halts before her and solemnly
utters a series of low grunts like “oak, oak, oak.” Having
thereby declared his passion, and commonly without
gaining any answering response, he returns to his normal
shape again!</p>

<p>It is curious that a near relative of this bird, the Great
Australian Bustard (<i>Eupodotis australis</i>), also captures
the wind to declare his love; but it is disposed of after
a quite different fashion, being drawn into the gullet,
though the precise manner in which it is manipulated
demands further investigation. The display Dr. Murie
described many years ago. It begins, he tells us, with a
swelling of the throat, while the head is thrown upwards.
Immediately after, the neck swells, and the feathers of
the lower part of the neck, set all on end, are carried
downwards, apparently surrounding a huge bag which
reaches nearly to the ground. During all this time the
head and neck are held rigid and point skywards, the head
surmounting a great feathery column. Meanwhile the
tail, as with the Great Bustard, is drawn forwards over
the back. In this peculiar attitude the bird struts about
in a stiff, waddling manner, the elongated neck-bag swaying
to and fro and the feathers of the throat standing out
in the shape of a great rounded swelling. The acme of
inspiratory effort completed, the bird begins to snap the
jaws together, producing loud noises, which are accompanied
by a soft dove-like cooing.</p>

<p>The Pectoral Sandpiper in like manner inflates its
gullet. But, unlike the Pigeon and the bird just described,
the neck is not markedly straightened, nor is the body
raised. As the air is drawn in, the gullet expands, till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>it forms a great spherical drum. Then the excited performer
runs along the ground uttering a resonant “too-u
tooo-u” repeated seven or eight times in rapid succession,
all the while he approaches nearer to the apparently very
much-otherwise-engaged female. This effort failing, he
will then often rise on quivering wings twenty or thirty
feet into the air, and dive gracefully down again immediately
afterwards, deflating this curious balloon to await
a more favourable opportunity.</p>

<p>In some species where wind-bags are employed as
aphrodisiacs the outer skin is brilliantly coloured and
exposed during the display. The Prairie-hen affords a
case in point. In this species the air-chamber is furnished,
not by the gullet, but by the air-sacs of the neck.
When these are inflated they appear as two large orange-coloured
bodies standing boldly out among the feathers.
Their effect is heightened by a tuft of long stiff feathers
which are thrust forward like a pair of horns, on each
side of the head, while at the same time the feathers of
the back are set on end, the tail is spread like a great
fan, and the wings are half opened and trailed like those
of the Turkey.</p>

<p>The displays take place in the early hours of the morning,
when parties of from a dozen to fifty, of both sexes, meet
on some slight knolls where the grass is short. Having
duly assembled, the more ardent cocks immediately begin
to prepare for the morning revels, the first part of the
performance apparently being of a comparatively passive
nature—the parade of the air-sacs and the erection of
the feathers.</p>

<p>Then some “proud cock, in order to complete his
triumph, will rush forward at his best speed ... through
the midst of the love-sick damsels, pouring out as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>goes a booming noise ... which may be heard for at
least two miles in the morning air. This sound is by
no means harsh or unpleasant. When standing in the
open prairie at early dawn listening to hundreds of
different voices pitched in different keys, coming from
every direction and from various distances, the listener
is rather soothed than excited.</p>

<p>“Every few minutes this display is repeated. I have
seen not only one, but more than twenty cocks going
through this funny operation at once; but then they
seem careful not to run against each other, for they have
not yet got to the fighting point. After a little while the
lady birds begin to show an interest in the proceedings by
moving about quickly, a few yards at a time, and then
standing still a short time.</p>

<p>“The party breaks up when the sun is half an hour
high, to be repeated the next morning, and every morning
for a week or two before all make satisfactory matches.
It is towards the latter part of the love-season that the
fighting takes place among the cocks, probably by two
who have fallen in love with the same sweetheart....”</p>

<p>There is much that is extremely interesting in this
account and a little that seems to have been misinterpreted.
The fact that these antics are repeated
during many days until at last the females are moved
to display some interest is just what we should expect
if this demonstrative behaviour on the part of the males
acts, as we believe, as an aphrodisiac. And that actual
fighting occurs is highly probable, but there can be no
doubt that in such case the whole aspect of the bird
must be changed, for anything in the nature of fighting
with the delicate air-sacs inflated would greatly endanger
the most important aid to success in achieving this object
which these birds possess.</p>

<p>During the “display” large, yellow, air-sacs in the neck are inflated. The bird in the foreground shows one of
these, and the ornamental feather frill, very clearly.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 110.</p></div>

<p>No less remarkable is the performance of the Frigate-bird
(<i>Fregata</i>), a tropical species allied to the Pelicans
and Boatswain-bird, and to our own more familiar Cormorants
and Gannets. It might well be called a marine
Swift, having excessively short legs and small feet, and
a wonderful expanse of wing. As with the Swifts, of
course most of its time is spent on the wing; the feet
are only useful for supporting the body when ashore,
they are never used for walking, at any rate, for more
than a few steps. The wings afford the only means of
locomotion. Our knowledge of these birds when under
the stress of sexual excitement we owe to Dr. C. W.
Andrews, who had the good fortune to study the
species known as the Great Frigate-bird (<i>Fregata aquila</i>)
during his task of surveying Christmas Island (Indian
Ocean).</p>

<p>“About the beginning of January,” he remarks, “the
adult males begin to acquire a remarkable pouch of
scarlet skin beneath the throat; this they can inflate
till it is nearly as large as the rest of the body, and a
dozen or more of these birds sitting on a tree with outspread,
drooping wings and this great scarlet bladder
under their heads are a most remarkable sight. When
a hen bird approaches the tree the males utter a peculiar
cry, a sort of ‘wow-wow-wow-wow,’ and clatter their
beaks like castanets, at the same time shaking their
wings. When they take to flight the air is allowed to
escape from the pouch, but occasionally they might be
seen flying with it partly inflated.”</p>

<p>Here again there can be no doubt about the purpose, or
perhaps one should say the stimulus, of this strange performance.
This pouch, I have been enabled to ascertain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>from dissection, is not formed by inflating the gullet,
but, as in the case of the Prairie-hen, by the enlargement
of the air-sacs of the neck.</p>

<p>These air-sacs, which are present in all birds, are only
enlarged to further the ends of sexual display in a few
species, and, curiously enough, these are in no way related
one to another. The Adjutant storks, it may be remarked
in this connection, have used the air-sacs which are fed
by the nasal system instead of those fed by the lungs,
as in all the species so far described. When deflated this
pouch forms a quite inconspicuous conical swelling in
front of the neck; under the stimulus of excitement,
it awakens as it were into activity, and is suddenly
transformed into a great red or red-and-black bag, encircling
the neck and projecting far downwards in front
of it, only to be deflated an instant later with a speed
which leaves one gasping.</p>

<p>The specialization of the air-sacs, that is to say their
transformation to perform new functions subservient to
the ends of sexual activities, is not exclusively confined
to display. In at least one instance an air-sac has been
specially developed to act as a voice resonator. This
is furnished by the Emu, wherein the wind-pipe, near the
middle of its length and on its anterior aspect, has a
number of incomplete rings forming a long slit. The
lining of the windpipe escapes from this slit in a hernia-like
pouch, and takes up a position beneath the skin.
Even when inflated this pouch gives no very obvious
sign of its existence, but it serves to produce a curious
hollow, drumming sound, like the boom of a big drum
softly beaten. But why it should have been developed,
when the Ostrich and the Cassowary produce similar
but louder “music” without any special apparatus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>whatever, is a mystery. At least one species of Cassowary
can emit a roar which would do credit to a
lion.</p>

<p>In the males of all healthy animals the periodic
stimulus to reproduction finds expression in more or
less striking eccentricity of conduct. Sometimes, as the
foregoing instances have shown, this has been exaggerated
by the development of long, resplendent plumes: sometimes
by brilliant coloration, displayed either by the
plumage or by bare areas of skin, or by both, while in not
a few cases attitudes, to our eyes grotesque and made
still more so by the aid of inflatable pouches, are the
outward and visible sign of the raging fires within. For
the completion of this chapter yet other instances of this
kind must be cited, instances which reveal a further
elaboration of some of the more striking of these tricks
of posturing; or which concern the growth of the aggressive
instincts, which are proclaimed by the development of
armature often of a very formidable character. As
the sequel shows, however, there are no hard and fast
dividing lines between these several modes of expression.</p>

<p>That remarkable bird, the Ruff (<i>Machetes pugnax</i>),
now, alas! no longer to be met with in our fens, exhibits
a curiously composite character in the phases of its love
display.</p>

<p>Preparations for this are begun in the early spring by
the assumption of what is called a “nuptial dress,”
which is worn only by the male, and which contrasts in
a very conspicuous manner with the plumage worn
during the rest of the year. The most striking features
of this dress are the great, erectile, Elizabethan ruff which
encircles the neck immediately behind the head, and
the long, tongue-shaped “ears” which surmount the
head itself. These exhibit a most remarkable diversity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>in their coloration, and it is no exaggeration to say that
no two are ever alike. Red, cream-colour, buff, black,
white; spotted, streaked, freckled and barred are the
only descriptions that can be applied to them, for the
combinations of their hues and patterns seem infinite.
Having grasped this fact, the eye next turns to the
colouring of the rest of the body, and it will be found
that here too is the same diversity, though less conspicuously
so; and finally it will be noticed that at this
time the feathers around the base of the beak have been
replaced by yellow or orange-coloured papillæ. The
females also now wear a dress differing from that of the
so-called “winter plumage,” but it does not present any
very striking features nor any form of ornamentation
comparable to that of the males.</p>

<p>The Ruff is a polygamous bird, which, in its display,
presents some curious and puzzling features, one of which
consists of a sort of tournament between rival males.
At the break of day the performers, selecting such
eminences as the fen-lands afford, assemble apparently
to display their finery, for a couple of males will often
stand facing one another with frills erected and beaks
touching the ground, silent and immovable, for perhaps
half a minute. Sooner or later, however, they will
commence to spar, and this presently leads to blows,
during which one of the combatants will attempt to
seize the other by the wings. However, no damage
seems to be inflicted during such encounters, which are
by no means aimless or profitless, for during such bouts
the weaker, less vigorous birds are driven from the field,
and the victor in consequence wins for himself a larger
harem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>When the actual pairing time arrives the parade of
the frills begins again. The amorous instincts, it is
important to notice, are awakened earlier in the males,
so that by the time the females have attained to a like
condition the least mettlesome males have been driven
off. What follows is not the selection by the females of
the finest performers so much as a process of sorting
out, whereby the females discover and cleave to those
males which are readiest for mating. This display
succeeds in revealing both the most mettlesome males
and the most amorous females, who, however, would
seem to require great persistence and much demonstration
on the part of the males before they can be finally aroused
to the pitch necessary for pairing. Again and again
a male may be seen to approach an apparently very
unconcerned female, and then to crouch down before
her with his beak pressed to the ground and his frill and
“ears” set off to their fullest. For some seconds he
will remain lost in apparent contemplation, then with
a dazed, far-off, expression he will look up, to find, as often
as not, that she is still apparently feeding, quite unmoved
by his protestations; or that she has even flown off and
left him. Pursuit speedily follows, and the performance
is repeated until at last she too catches the flame of
passion and permits, or rather invites, the final act of
sexual congress.</p>

<p>Though these birds on occasion will fight, and savagely,
they cannot inflict serious damage on one another by
reason of the relative feebleness of their beaks and legs,
which are but ill-adapted for violent measures. Inasmuch
as the Ruff is a polygamous species, these bloodless
battles have a peculiar interest. They show that the
preponderance of females, which polygamy implies, is
not, as is commonly supposed to be the case, due to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>high death-rate among the males by fighting. The same
is true of the Wydah-birds, and their kin, the only
polygamous species among the Passeres.</p>

<p>In this connection it is to be remarked that fighting,
of a more or less sanguinary character, is apparently
universal among birds, the conflicts being waged
not so much in the way of squabbles for the possession
of females as for the acquisition and retention of
territory and all that this entails during the breeding
season and, to a much less extent, in the defence
of the eggs and young. But to this point we must
return. For the moment it will be more profitable
to focus attention on the character of this fighting. In
the first place, it is by no means necessary that the
combatants should be armed. The “dove of peace”
at this time of the year appears in a new and not always
pleasing light, for not only will he fight his neighbours,
but he does not always show that gentleness towards
his wife with which tradition has credited him. The
little Humming-bird would seem to be as little capable
of fighting as a bird could be, yet few are more pugnacious.
The naturalist Gosse tells of a pair which had torn one
another’s tongues out in their blind fury; and everybody
knows that Robins and Tits fight savagely to preserve
their chosen haunts from invasion by their neighbours.
In some birds this pugnacity has become an overmastering
passion. Some of the Quails, and a species of Rail (<i>Gallicrex
cristatus</i>), a near relation of the Moorhen, are
commonly kept by the natives of the East, as our forefathers
kept Fighting-cocks, for the sake of seeing them
fight one another. Yet, save in the case of the Fighting-cock,
neither of these birds possesses any aggressive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>weapons.</p>

<p>Among the game-birds, however, powerful armature,
in the shape of long, pointed, spurs on the legs are met
with. In the Jungle-fowls and Pheasants only a single
pair are found on each leg, but in other species, as in
the Francolins, there are several pairs, and these birds,
it is instructive to notice, are notorious for the ferocity
of their encounters. It is said that in the Indian Swamp-Francolin
(<i>Francolinus gularis</i>) nearly every individual
is marked by scars and wounds received in duels with
rivals.</p>

<p>Certain members of the Plover-tribe, and certain
Anserine birds, have developed spurs of a very formidable
character on the wings. Among the Plover-tribe the
best example of such armoured species is the Egyptian
Spur-winged Plover (<i>Hoplopterus</i>). This bird, after the
fashion of its unarmoured relatives, such as the Common
Lapwing, fights by turning suddenly in the air and
striking with the wings. In the case of the formidably
armed Egyptian bird the result is often fatal; but with
our Lapwing a fatal result is rare, since but slightly
swollen knobs take the place of spurs. In Hoplopterus
and in the Jacana this spur arises from the base of the
thumb, but in the Spur-winged Goose (<i>Plectropterus</i>)
it is borne by one of the wrist bones (the radial) while
in the aberrant Geese-like birds (<i>Palamedea</i> and
<i>Chauna</i>) there are two spurs on each wring, one at
each end of the metacarpus. That these weapons have
come into being in response to need seems a very natural
conclusion, but it is one which presents many difficulties
when more closely examined. The wing spurs, differing
widely in their nature as they do, in one case borne on
a carpal bone, in others on the metacarpus, seem rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>to owe their origin to fortuitous variations which have
become, so to speak, adopted by selection, than to a
response to the oft-repeated stimuli incidental to fighting.
The latter explanation is Lamarckian and to-day finds
favour with but few. The stimulus theory seems to be
effectually discounted by the existence of the spurs on
the legs of gallinaceous birds. That these owe their
origin to impacts, or blows, seems more than doubtful:
and one can hardly see how they could have served any
useful purpose until they had attained a sufficient length
to serve as weapons. Even if we suppose that the spurs
of, say, the Jungle-fowl or the Francolin have been
derived from tuberosities such as are found on the legs
of the French Partridge (<i>Caccabis rufa</i>), we should still
lack evidence that the use of the legs in fighting caused
the origin of the tuberosities.</p>

<p>There is yet another puzzling feature in regard to the
armature of the wings, and one which may yet help to a
better understanding of the puzzles presented by spurs.
A Jacana, one of the Plovers, has the radius broadened
or flattened out from its middle onwards to form a flat
plate or blade, but the use thereof is unknown. It may
possibly serve as a weapon of offence, enabling the bird
to beat its rivals with its wings, but from the nature of
the structure, and of the effect such a use of the forearm
would have upon the hand, it seems doubtful whether
it serves any aggressive function. If used at all in
fighting it is probably during fights in mid-air, when,
after the fashion pursued by the Spur-winged Plover,
and even in the case of our own Lapwing, a blow is struck
by the uppermost bird at its rival, and often with fatal
effect. It is significant to remark, by the way, that in
the Lapwing a tubercle answers to the spur of Hoplopterus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>just as the tubercles of the French Partridge (<i>Caccabis</i>)
answer to the spur of the Jungle-fowl or Pheasant: but
the flattened radius of the wing of the <i>Metopidius jacana</i>
has no parallel.</p>

<p>With birds, as with men, there must always remain
the ability to appeal to force when some important end
cannot otherwise be gained. The species which adopts
the crazy tactics of the Quaker is doomed to extinction,
sooner or later. The foregoing instances display force,
as we may say, aggressively. But even the peacefully
disposed birds can fight when aroused.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to dancing in this
chapter; but so far no very striking instances thereof
as a form of sexual display have been cited. The
subject has been deferred because this peculiar type of
activity is not always directly associated with the <i>furor
amantium</i>.</p>

<p>With some species, which, it should be remarked, also
lack distinctive colouring, the erotic state is manifested
apparently not so much by the display of expanded wings
and tail as by frenzied dances. The Jacanas, aberrant
members of the Plover tribe resident in South America,
are expert performers, displaying moreover a curious
spontaneity during such outbursts. A flock will be
apparently sedulously feeding when suddenly and with
quick, excited gestures all will cluster together in a
group and go through a singular and pretty performance,
holding their wings outstretched and agitated, some with
a fluttering and others with more leisurely movement,
like that of a butterfly sunning itself. The performance
over, all scatter and feed again.. The Honourable Walter
Rothschild, in his “Avi-fauna of Laysan” tells us of
the stately Albatross, which breeds, or rather bred there—for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>the Japanese display a singular callousness in regard
to animal life where commercial interests are concerned in
thousands: “First they stand face to face, then they
begin nodding and bowing vigorously, then rub their
bills together with a whistling cry. After this they
begin shaking their heads and snapping their bills with
marvellous rapidity, occasionally lifting one wing, straightening
themselves out and blowing out their breasts;
then they put their bills under the wing or toss them in
the air with a groaning scream, and walk round each
other often for fifteen minutes at a time.”</p>

<p>Cranes are much given to dancing. Mr. Nelson, an
American ornithologist, has described with much vigour
the dancing of the Sandhill Crane in Alaska. As he
lay in a “hunting-blind” he was suddenly aroused by
the arrival of a crane, followed speedily by a second,
uttering his loud note as he came, until he espied the
first-comer on the ground, when he made a circuit and
dropped close by. Both birds then joined in a series
of loud rolling cries in quick succession. Suddenly, the
last-comer, which seemed to be a male, wheeled his back
towards the female and made a low bow, his head nearly
touching the ground, and ending by a quick leap into the
air. Another pirouette brought him facing his charmer,
whom he greeted with a still deeper bow, his wings
trailing loosely by his sides. She replied by an answering
bow and hop, and then tried to outdo the other in a
series of spasmodic hops and starts, mixed with a set of
comically grave and ceremonious bows. The pair stood
for some moments bowing right and left, when the legs
appeared to become envious of the large share taken in the
performance by the neck, and then would ensue a series
of skilled hops and skips, like the steps of a minuet. Such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>antics are characteristic of the Cranes of all species, and
sometimes a whole flock will join in such dances. But,
it is to be noted, they are not necessarily signs of the
<i>furor amantium</i>: they certainly always accompany
this, but frequently they are indulged in, apparently,
solely as an outlet for exuberance of feeling.</p>

<p>Before the theme of dancing can be dismissed the
performance of a small species of perching bird, one of
the South American Manakins, must be described.
The natives call it the “Bailador,” or dancer. In an
account of his travels in Nicaragua Mr. Nutting tells us:
“I once witnessed one of the most remarkable performances
it was ever my lot to see. Upon a bare twig ... at
about four feet from the ground, two male
‘bailadors’ were engaged in a song and dance act that
simply astonished me. The two birds were about a
foot and half apart and were alternately jumping about
two feet in the air and alighting exactly on the spot whence
they jumped. The time was as regular as clockwork,
one bird jumping up the instant the other alighted, each
bird accompanying himself to the tune of to-le-do—to-le-do—to-le-do,
sounding the syllable to as he crouched
to spring, le while in the air, and do as he alighted. This
performance was kept up without intermission for more
than a minute, when the birds suddenly discovered they
had an audience and made off.” Here again we have
no evidence of the <i>furor amantium</i>; nor that any females
were spectators of the scene.</p>

<p>It is important to notice that Mr. Howard, in the course
of his study of the Warblers, witnessed a performance
having some likeness to this on the part of three young
Sedge Warblers but newly escaped from the nursery.
And this not in some solitary instance, but on several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>occasions. Just after leaving the nest, he remarks, they
are very playful, “their games sometimes taking the
form of a tilting match. Three take part; two sit on
convenient twigs facing one another, and the third, from
the central position, might almost be called an umpire.
Numbers One and Two lower their heads, each in anticipation
of the other moving; one of them, call him Number
One, then springs into the air and darts at Number Two:
Number Two dodges and occupies the position vacated
by Number One; each of them then faces round ready
to continue the fray, the change of positions becoming
quite rapid.” But no recurrence of these antics has been
noted during the course of the adult sexual display, which
is confined to posturing and displaying the outspread
wings and tail. Nevertheless there can be no doubt
but that such games in later life are incorporated, in
the case of many species, with the love display.</p>

<p>That the reproductive glands have played, and still
play, a by no means unimportant rôle in Evolution is
shown by the history of the secondary sexual characters.
Among the birds, at any rate, the early stages of physical
changes belonging to this “figuration” are to be seen in
various forms of posturing, which in their more elaborate
developments we call “dances.” In many cases, as for
example among the Warblers, the periods of sex-emotion
are marked by posturing alone. But in a number of
species, as has already been shown, the products of the
sexual gland seem to have undergone some further
elaboration which has resulted in the additional phenomena
of gaudy coloration, in hypertrophied plumes, and in
weapons of offence.</p>

<p>But not yet is the list of such sexual products
exhausted, for no mention has so far been made of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>development of the many wonderful devices for the
production of peculiar and arresting sounds, musical and
otherwise. These are of two kinds: one wherein certain
feathers have been modified to produce rhythmical notes
either by percussion or by vibration; the other wherein
the internal organs have been modified to produce musical
notes or loud, resonant cries.</p>

<p>Instances of the latter kind are innumerable, and as a
consequence no more than one or two can be cited in
these pages. The facts associated with the production of
vocal, as distinct from instrumental, music are both
curious and puzzling. To begin with, this music is
produced by the lower end of the trachea or windpipe,
which has become modified in various ways, though not
so strictly in relation to the sounds produced as is
commonly supposed. The anatomical details of these
modifications cannot, or rather need not, be described
now, save in the most general terms.</p>

<p>Briefly the syrinx, or organ of voice, of birds, is formed
in part by the lowermost rings which form the tubular
windpipe, and in part by the smaller pair of tubes which,
running therefrom to the lungs, form the bronchi. These
last are formed of semi-rings only, the inner wall of the
tube being formed by very delicate translucent membranes.
As air is forced from the lungs along the bronchi and up
the windpipe, the modulation of the voice is effected by
muscles which regulate the amount of air driven through
the syrinx, and the height of the column in the tube;
the latter being effected by muscles which alternately
lengthen and shorten it.</p>

<p>So far so good. Next it is to be noted that this syrinx
presents a great variety of modifications, or types,
differing not only in plan, but also in the number and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>distribution of the muscles for its manipulation. The
most accomplished performers are to be found among
that great group of birds known as the Passeres, or
perching birds, wherein the number of these muscles is
never less than five pairs, and generally rises to seven.
This association of musculature with performance is
exactly what we should expect. In Nature, however,
it is always the unexpected that happens. In the first
place, the females are, so far as the dissecting-knife and
the microscope can show, as well provided as the males,
yet they do not sing. In the second, the Nightingale
and the Crow are equally endowed, so far as we can
discover, yet it is unnecessary to state that the talents
which the Crow possesses are never used! More disconcerting
still is the reflection that the Parrot, which is
far less generously endowed by Nature in so far as singing
muscles are concerned, is a much more skilful performer,
inasmuch as it will reproduce with equal fidelity the
human voice and the song of the Canary! The latter
feat, at any rate, has been accomplished with amazing
accuracy both by the little Budgerigar (<i>Melopsittacus
undulatus</i>) and the Quaker Parrot (<i>Myopsittacus monachus</i>).
In their wild state the Parrot family are notorious for
their discordant cries. It is therefore the more remarkable
that such feats should be capable of attainment. But
wherefore the elaborate syrinx of the Nightingale, if the
simple type seen in the Parrot is capable of the same
result, and why the elaborate syrinx in the case of the
Crow, which never attains to a greater perfection of vocal
effort than the wild Parrot?</p>

<p>One speaks of the syrinx of the Parrot as of a simpler
type because of its feebler musculature and the lesser
complexity of its framework, but it is nevertheless a more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>efficient instrument, since it is capable of reproducing
both the human voice and songs such as that of the Canary.
This fact becomes still more remarkable when we reflect
that the natural voice of the Parrot, as we have just
remarked, attains to no more than a harsh screech. How
is it that, capable of so much, it has achieved so little?
The same question may be asked in the case of the
Raven. This bird has a syrinx indistinguishable from
that of the Nightingale, save in point of size; yet
the Raven’s voice is never musical, nor can it be
trained to such an achievement. Like the Parrot,
however, it can be taught to speak, though its vocabulary
is never so extensive. One would have imagined that
when the syrinx of, say, the Raven, or any of the Crow
tribe, was compared with that of the Nightingale or the
Skylark, some structural differences, commensurate with
the difference in performance, would be discovered; but
such is not the case.</p>

<p>What interpretation are we to place on these paradoxical
facts? One cannot help asking why seven pairs
of muscles should have been produced by one group of
birds to perform what can as easily be achieved in
another by two? It is true that the more generously
endowed species are musicians by birth, the others only
by training. But one cannot make a silk purse out of a
sow’s ear. In like manner one asks why male and female,
possessing precisely similar voice-organs, should not sing
equally well, but they do not. Evidently mere mechanism
does not alone answer these questions.</p>

<p>Some, perhaps, may see in them instances of what
is known as “Hypertely,” wherein the bounds of mere
utility seem to be transcended. Hypertely, however,
implies something more than this: it implies a shooting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>beyond the mark, the overdoing of a feature, where the
momentum gained, from some obscure cause, keeps on
being increased by cumulative inheritance: and not being
checked by Natural Selection, causes the species in
respect of such characters to pass beyond its congeners.
Professor Lloyd Morgan’s theory of “over-production”
would seem better to apply here, though in a somewhat
different sense from that used by him. For in the
instances just quoted there is a latent potentiality for
response to new demands which the struggle for existence
may make, but a potentiality varying in degree, and here
selection finds its <i>métier</i>.</p>

<p>Yet further illustrations of secondary sexual characters,
such as are concerned with vocal music, must now be
considered. The discussion of these has been designedly
deferred. They embrace instances of voice production
more singular than any yet referred to, and if possible
more difficult to interpret.</p>

<p>The facts first to be reviewed concern the syrinx of
certain of the Anatidæ. It is noteworthy that each
of the three divisions of this group—the Swans, Geese and
Ducks—contains species in which either the syrinx or the
windpipe has acquired some singular feature. In the
surface-feeding Ducks, modifications of the syrinx are
most frequently found. Commonly, as in the Mallard,
this takes the form of a spherical bony case; in the diving
Ducks this bony chamber has enormously increased in
size. Furthermore it has conspicuously changed both
in form and character: for it is now roughly trihedral
in form, and its walls present large <i>fenestræ</i> closed only
by delicate membrane, suggesting that the increased
size of the chamber has not been accompanied by a
corresponding increase of bony tissue for its construction.
Hence all that is available is used for the construction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>of girders to form supports for the now membranous
chamber walls. Some species seem to show that this
fenestration has been pushed to excess, leaving only
vestiges of this singular chamber, as is shown in PI. 21.
In some species the bronchi are much swollen, and the
syringeal chamber has entirely disappeared: in others,
as in the Merganser and Goosander, a large syringeal
chamber is supplemented by dilatations of the windpipe.</p>

<p class="right">[Face Page 126.</p></div>

<p>Save in the case of the Goosander, these peculiar
structures are found only in the male, but in the species
first named the male, in addition to the syringeal chamber,
has two fusiform swellings in the windpipe, one above
the other: in the female one of these swellings is
present, but there is no syringeal box.</p>

<p>This box is generally, and probably correctly, regarded
as a sort of musical instrument. Nevertheless the males
are far less vociferous than the females which have no
such voice resonator. One has only to listen to, and
compare the notes of the Mallard drake and duck to
discover this fact. Here, then, we seem indeed to have
a case of “Hypertely.” Before, however, we build too
much on this we must discover whether the sibilant sounds
uttered by the males do, or do not, play an important
part in arousing the sexual passions of the females.</p>

<p>Certain of the Swans and Cranes afford illustrations
of musical instruments of an even more remarkable kind.
Herein the windpipe at the base of the neck enters a
large chamber formed by the absorption of the diploe
sandwiched between the outer walls of the keel of the
breastbone and the enlargement of the space so created
until it can accommodate the tubular windpipe. This,
entering the cavity in the form of a loop, runs the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>length of the keel, the upper limb of the loop finally
running to the lungs. That we have here an indubitable
musical instrument there can be no question, for its
possessor is enabled thereby to utter loud, trumpet-like,
if harsh, sounds. Here again only the males are so
provided.</p>

<p>The profound interest of this really extraordinary
association of unrelated structures has never attracted
the attention it deserves. Originally, no doubt, one would
have met with nothing more than a loop of the windpipe
impinging against the anterior border of a normal, blade-like
keel: later there would have been formed a broad
shallow surface on the keel at the point of contact
with the loop, and gradually the depression must have
deepened till the bony chamber came into being. By
what nexus of sympathy were these reciprocal responses
made?</p>

<p>Another very singular type of looped windpipe is that
wherein the trachea forms a series of coils between the
body and the skin. It is surely somewhat surprising
to find that precisely similar coils are met with in widely
different groups of birds. Among the Passeres they occur
in the Manucode: among the Plovers in the Painted
Snipe (<i>Rhynchea rostratula</i>): among the game-birds in
some of the Curassows, and among the Anatidæ in the
aberrant Australian Black-and-White Goose (<i>Anseranas</i>).</p>

<p>Very little is really known of the part played by these
musical instruments of the Anatidæ, nor, for the matter
of that, of most of the “musicians” among birds. Of
some of the game-birds more has been gleaned, and among
these surely the most interesting is the love-song or “lek”
of the Capercaillie. With the advent of April the cock,
just before dawn, repairs to some favourite tree—used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>year after year—and there performs a most astonishing
if unmusical serenade; with outstretched neck, drooping
wings and spreading tail he gives forth a weird, uncouth
kind of song, more or less divisible into three parts. He
begins with a series of notes which remind one of nothing
so much as the sound made by two sticks knocked
together at intervals of ten to fifteen seconds, getting
quicker and quicker, and changing in key till at last
they become bell-like. Then follows a series of sounds
like the drawing of a cork out of a bottle, and these end
with bird-like twitterings. By this time, however, the
singer has worked himself up to an ecstasy of fervour and
passion so intense as to deaden him to all that may be
passing in the outer world. During these moments no
sound disturbs him, partly, apparently, because the
excitement of the “song” causes a turgid condition of
the blood-vessels which for the time effectually deafens
him. “Sportsmen,” in Swedish and other European
forests, knowing this, select such performances as affording
the most favourable time for Capercaillie shooting, only
cocks being selected.</p>

<p>A survey must now be made of some of the more
remarkable cases whereby more or less musical, or
rhythmical, sounds are made by instruments of percussion;
or by rapid vibrations. These are in almost every
instance formed by varying grades of modification in
the feathers of the wings or tail. Their presence, and
their use, seem natural enough until we recall the fact
that many other birds without any apparatus whatever,
make sounds in no way less remarkable or less penetrating.
Pigeons, Nightjars and Owls, for example, can produce
at will curious snapping sounds by bringing the wings
smartly together over the back. The White, and Shoebilled
Storks make castanets of the beak, throwing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>head backwards till the point of the beak touches the
back, when the jaws are set rapidly clashing one against
another, producing a sound comparable to the “bones”
of negro minstrels, but without the varying rhythm. As
this performance is proceeding, the head and neck are
slowly moved through half a circle, till the tip of the beak
touches the ground, when the music ceases. As with the
wing-snapping just referred to, both sexes are equally
skilful performers; but while they seem to indulge in such
exercises much more frequently, and with more vim
during the breeding season, they will break out after
this demonstrative fashion at all times of the year. But
why, then, the need for the yet more elaborate contrivances
which are to be met with among the Snipe,
the Game-birds, and certain of the Passeres?</p>

<p>However, be this as it may, in a large number of species
a special mechanism has been evolved to produce sounds
which, as has been remarked, in other species are no less
effectually made without that mechanism.</p>

<p>One of the simplest of the cases is that furnished by
the remarkable “bleating” or “drumming” performances
of many species of Snipe, generally, if not only, when
sexually excited, and especially of the Common Snipe
(<i>Gallinago cœlestis</i>) during its love-flights. Mounting
to a great height, this bird, at such times, suddenly
turns, and descends with prodigious speed, meanwhile
holding the tail fully expanded. The outermost pair
of feathers are, however, specially modified so that, in
the first place, during this descent they stand at right
angles to the long axis of the body and well apart from
the rest of the tail-feathers. This alone, however, would
not produce these weird sounds, which owe their origin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>to the fact that these particular feathers have their shafts
conspicuously thickened and peculiarly curved, while
the vane or web of the inner side of the feather is of great
width and structurally differs from the vanes of the other
feathers, whereby the vane becomes more resistant to
the rush of air caused by the wings during the descent.</p>

<p>But in the case of these Snipe it is to be noted this
curious form of musical instrument is found in both sexes,
and there is little difference in the quality of the sounds
produced, but the bleating of the male is said to be the
more resonant.</p>

<p>The Common Snipe is the best performer among several
different species, and it is to be noted presents, to a
casual examination, no remarkable or peculiar feature
whatever—the structural differences just described are
only to be discovered by very patient scrutiny. But in
the Pin-tailed Snipe (<i>Gallinago stenura</i>) the number of
the feathers has been greatly increased, while at the
same time their webs have been so reduced that the outspread
tail seems to consist of little more than spines.
With such a transformation one expects to find a quite
exceptional performance, far surpassing that of the
Common Snipe. Yet so far as observation and experiment
go they effect absolutely nothing! Here again we have
a case where modification of structure has passed the
bounds of need and passed so far as to make the whole
tail useless as a sound-producing organ!</p>

<p>A contrast and a parallel are afforded by some of the
gallinaceous birds of South America. The Black Penelope
(<i>Penelopina nigra</i>) of Guatemala, while on the wing,
will, during its “love-flights,” pitch suddenly earthwards
with outstretched wings, and at such times a crashing,
rushing sound is produced, which has been likened to
the sound of a falling tree. Yet there is nothing in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>shape of the wing which will account for this. On the
other hand, a near relation of this bird, the Black-wattled
Guan, <i>Aburria</i> (<i>Penelope</i>) <i>aburri</i> has the four outermost
primaries deeply incised along their inner vanes, reducing
the outermost portion of the feathers to mere spines.
Yet, so far as is known, this wing makes no especial noise.
However, the males of certain little South American
Perching-birds known as Manakins have the shafts of
the secondary quills thickened to an extraordinary degree
so as to form solid, horny lumps, and these, when the
wings are brought together smartly over the back, produce
a noise not unlike the crack of a whip, so that here
again structure and function are found together. In the
contradictory cases just cited where specialized parts are
found which are apparently functionless, we must suppose
that the habit of using them has been supplanted by some
new stimulant.</p>

<p>The part played by musical instruments of percussion
would seem to be a variable one. In some cases, and
possibly in all, it may serve as an excitant, or stimulant, to
the rousing of a “sex-storm”; in many, at any rate,
such sounds serve as calls to the sexes when separated.
This much seems to be demonstrated in the case of certain
of the Woodpeckers, which in this matter differ conspicuously
from any other species yet referred to, in
that they have developed no special sound-producing
mechanism, but make use of hollow trees which serve
them as drums, the beak being used as the drumstick.
This is a very noteworthy fact, for one would have
supposed that here at any rate, where the production of
loud and far-reaching sounds is of vital importance, the
means would have been provided by some such modification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>of the wing-feathers as we have already seen to
obtain in the case, for example, of the Manakins. More
closely examined, however, this apparent failure of the
organism to produce its own mechanism becomes less
remarkable, for Woodpeckers are forest-dwellers and but
indifferent fliers; loud sounds produced by the rapid
vibration of the wings or tail, as in the case of the Snipe,
in mid-air, are thus impracticable, if not impossible,
and sounds produced after the fashion of the Manakins
would not have sufficient carrying power.</p>

<p>One of the most skilled performers among the
Woodpeckers is the Great Spotted Woodpecker (<i>Dendrocofus
major</i>), whose weird drumming once heard will
never be forgotten. These sounds are produced by blows
of the beak on a branch, delivered so rapidly that the
bird’s head presents but a blurred appearance. The
sounds thus made vary with the resonance of the wood
and can be heard at a distance of half a mile. These
strange vibrating notes are most frequently heard during
the courting season, and they will commonly beget a
speedy response from some more or less distant part of
the wood, so that their purpose is clear. They attain
the same end as the bellowing of the stag or the “lek”
of the Capercaillie. They are, however, to be heard at
other times, as when the birds are greatly alarmed or
when the nest is being robbed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br /><br />

<small><small>THE SEXUAL SELECTION THEORY AS APPLIED TO BIRDS</small></small></h2>

<p class="indent f08">Where the Rôle of the Sexes is reversed—Polygamy and how it is
brought about—Coloration and Courtship—Instinctive Actions—The
Importance of Landed Possessions—The Meaning of
“Display”—The Springs of “Behaviour”—A New Light on
the Wild-duck—The “Display” of the Great-crested Grebe—Some
Neglected Factors.</p>

<p>The significance of the varied behaviour of birds—more
especially of the males—during the period of reproductive
activity must now be more minutely analysed. But
before this analysis can be profitably begun, it will be
necessary to recall the fact that there are several cases
known wherein the rôle of the sexes is largely reversed.
Herein the females do the “courting,” and fight one
another as rivals for the males; while the males perform
the duties of incubation and brooding, and feeding the
young. This is really very remarkable, and demands more
attention than it has yet received.</p>

<p>What factors have brought about this curious reversal?
In any search for an explanation it must be borne in
mind that in all such cases polyandry is the rule, and
in all such cases the female is larger and more vividly
coloured than the male. Here, then, we have exactly
the opposite to what obtains in cases of polygamy. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>is the reason for this preponderance of males? Why
is it that when the males are in excess of the females the
latter should be the more brilliantly coloured and the
more amorous? These questions at present are unanswerable.
When polygamy obtains it seems always
to be assumed that it is explained by the excessive pugnacity
of the males, which, after fierce contests for the
mastery, take forcible possession of as many females as
may be captured and held in durance; the same argument
seems never to have been applied when polyandry obtains.
There can be no doubt but that it applies in neither case.</p>

<p>When polygamy obtains, as we have already pointed
out, the females are not seized and captured by the males,
they are not victims of a lecherous lord. On the contrary,
they seek the males, and the intensity of the desire to
satisfy their natural cravings extinguishes any feeling
of jealousy.</p>

<p>The same interpretation must obtain where the
numerical values of the sexes is reversed. Failure to
appreciate this accounts for one of the many futile
suggestions made for the suppression of the rabbit plague
in Australia, which was that large hauls of these pests
should be made by netting, and that the females should
be slain and the males released. This, it was held, would
lead to the speedy reduction of the latter, which would
kill one another in their fights for the remaining females.
The plan was impracticable, but the suggestion demonstrated
the prevalent belief as to the attitude of the male
in this respect. Had it been well founded, surely polyandrous
species, whether of birds or beasts, would never
have existed; for, by the reduction of the males, monogamy
would speedily have been restored. How, then, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>we to explain polyandry? How are we to explain the
fact, as it seems to be the fact, that the excess of males
has brought about such a complete reversal in behaviour—the
males, instead of the females, requiring the
aphrodisiac? The solution of this problem probably
lies with the physiologist. We now know that the
problem of sex does not rest merely in the complete
development of the primary sexual organs; we know
that fertile unions do not depend merely on the act of
pairing, but on the functional activity of those ancillary
glands already referred to. And it may well be that
some change in the character of the secretions has not
only altered the numerical values of the sexes, but
reversed the normal rôle of coloration and behaviour.
That is to say, neither polygamy nor polyandry among
the lower animals, at any rate, has been brought about
or is maintained by the excessive death-rate due to
combats for possession of mates, but must be explained
as demonstrating inherent changes in the germ-plasm,
disturbing the relative proportions of the sexes and
correlated with a profound transformation, not only
in the behaviour of the sexes during the period of
reproductive activity, but also in their physical
characteristics.</p>

<p>The action of the primary sexual glands and of the
ancillary glands has, then, to be allowed for in all
attempts to interpret behaviour in sexual matters. No
less so must this be the case in regard to the development
of coloration and other forms of ornament, and the genesis
of weapons of offence. But at present we are, in this
direction, dealing with an unknown quantity. The
recognition of this, however, should not deter us from
attempting to solve the riddle of sex from the phenomena
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>which have so far been surveyed.</p>

<p>To-day the interpretation which holds the field is
Darwin’s theory of “Sexual Selection.” But this was
framed rather to account for the existence of conspicuous
secondary sexual characters—the antlers of Deer, the
train of the Peacock, and so on; it did not take cognizance
of the unarmed, and the soberly-clad individuals. But
whatever shortcomings we may discover, real or
imaginary, in this theory, we must never forget that he
had not only to analyse and present his facts, but he
had first to collect them. This, in his case, was a more
laborious task than most people seem to suppose. Our
criticisms to-day are based, not so much on the revelations
of new facts, as on the harvests of his gleaning. Yet when
all is said and done, the theory of “Sexual Selection”
remains, though perhaps in a new setting.</p>

<p>To attempt to epitomize this theory is to essay a very
difficult task. But, in a condensed form, it may be said
to be a theory which accounts for the development of
secondary sexual characters, on the one hand through
the agency of conquest by battle, whereby rival males
strive for the possession of one or more females, who
have no choice in the matter, or who may deliberately
elect to follow the victor: and on the other by display
of conspicuous ornamentation, or of more or less grotesque
antics, or of some form of music, using this term in a
very wide sense. Wherever display is the agent, however,
its purpose seems to be to win the affections of the
female to whom such attentions are addressed. She is
supposed to elect to mate with the finest performers
of a number of suitors. In this way, it is assumed, the
intensity of the display, whatever its nature, has been
gradually increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>Wallace strongly opposed this, contending that it
assumed too much, that it assumed a common and uniform
standard of perfection shared by all the females concerned
in the selection, which is indeed assuming too much.
But his own theory was no more satisfactory. Indeed
it was very much less so, for he contended that these
various exaggerations of colour and form are to be
regarded simply as evidences of a superabundant vitality,
though there is no evidence that “superabundant vitality,”
if it exists, is a transmissible character.</p>

<p>The revised version of the Sexual Selection theory
advanced in these pages is largely inspired by the work
of Mr. H. Eliot Howard who, in his Monograph on the
British Warblers, has not only added very materially
to our knowledge of the life-histories of these birds, during
the reproductive period, but has also done much—both
in the direction of destructive, and constructive criticism,
of generally accepted conceptions on this head—to set
us on the right track for further research.</p>

<p>A study of his work leaves one with the conviction
that, while these birds exhibit what we may call a nascent
intelligence, their actions, on the whole, may be described
as instinctive, or congenitally definite. That is to say,
they follow one another in definite sequence. Hence we
must regard each new phase in the chain of events appertaining
to the reproductive cycle, as following one another
in a definite sequence, so that any break therein throws
the orderly performance of the necessary acts out of gear.
There is no realization of what reproduction means, no
deliberate striving to achieve that end. Each new phase
brings its own set of associations and sets a new train
of actions in motion, which are performed mechanically.
For instance, these Warblers, like hosts of other species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>under similar circumstances, are scrupulously careful to
remove the fæces of their young from the nest; thereby
preserving it in a sanitary condition. It is certain that
any neglect to do this would speedily end in the death of
the young. This act is “instinctive”; it is not performed
because the parents have evolved any views on
sanitation, and any strain in whom this instinct was
defective would speedily become eliminated. Mr. Howard
has demonstrated the mechanical character of this sanitary
measure by placing leaves in nests of young. The parents,
having fed their offspring, at once seized upon the leaf
and commenced to dispose of it after their usual fashion,
first by trying to swallow it and then by carrying it
away. They did not, evidently, realize the difference
between the texture of the leaf and the milk-white, jelly-like
envelope which always encloses the fæcal matter of
the nestling. We shall probably never know how this
most vitally important instinct came into being; nor can
we hope to discover what chain of happenings begot the
instinct, which each parent displays, to gently stimulate
the cloacal lips of their offspring in order to induce the
discharge of the fæces when this does not immediately
follow the stimulus of swallowing food.</p>

<p>We cannot credit these birds with notions on the
importance of the regular discharge of the evacuations.
Equally mysterious is the development of the envelope
enclosing the fæcal matter. This is jelly-like in substance,
and of considerable thickness, and is enclosed
within a very delicate skin or pellicle, enabling one to
lift the whole in the fingers without soiling them. How
and where it is formed should not long evade discovery.
But how it has come to be is another matter. We can, at
any rate, vaguely account for responses of the organism to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>internal stimuli reacting directly on the individual, but
here is an elaborate mechanism evolved in response to extra-personal
needs: and which cannot be regarded as of exactly
the same configuration as the instinct to feed the young.</p>

<p>A return must be made to the nature of the early phases
in the procession of the reproductive instincts. Mr.
Howard’s study of the Warblers seems to show conclusively
that these first manifest themselves in an overmastering
desire to seize upon territory large enough to ensure an
abundance of food for the offspring that are yet to be.
To this end the males arrive from their far-distant winter
quarters at least a week in advance of the females. Since
each returns approximately to the scene of last year’s
nursery, the arrivals are fairly distributed at the first;
but nevertheless this distribution inevitably brings a
conflict of interests between one or more males, perchance
young birds about to start in life, and having therefore
no definite objective. But whatever the reason, the
competition is there. The strongest male remains in
possession, and immediately commences to express the
ecstasy of feeling which possesses him in continuous
outbursts of song. Such, doubtless, answer to the bellowing
of the male stag. They advertise the presence of
a male to the female, who, as she arrives, would seem
to be already stirred by the rising storm of sexual desire,
for having once discovered a male in possession of the
all-necessary site for the nest, and the equally necessary
domain, each settles down to conjugal bliss: within
twenty-four hours the task of building has begun. There
is evidently here no sexual selection in Darwin’s sense:
no choice from among a number of males of the individual
which most excites desire within her; but the mating
of the most mettlesome, most virile males has been
determined before her arrival and by a double sieve. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>the first place, the duller-witted birds fail to secure suitable
territory, and in the second, the territory, having been
taken, must be held by force, so that only the strongest
males remain to mate when the females eventually arrive.
So far as one can see, selection is less exacting in the case
of the females, which apparently need do little more
than respond to the advances of the males.</p>

<p>With the advent of the females the amorous instincts
of the male speedily gather force; but for their satisfaction
it is imperative that the female should be possessed
by a like desire. To provoke this, for it is essential to
the well-being of the race that offspring should be produced
as early as possible, some form of aphrodisiac
seems to be necessary. This fact has never been properly
realized, though it is implied in Darwin’s theory of
“Sexual Selection.” Here, however, it was used to
account for the evolution of resplendent coloration,
eccentric postures, and dances which, it was assumed,
enabled or induced the female to choose the most
mettlesome males. What obtained among sombre-clad
species, appears to have excited no curiosity
among the students of the evolution theory. Hence
it comes somewhat as a surprise to find that the
soberly-clad Warblers behave exactly as though they too
wore coats of many colours. After what has been said in
the last chapter on this head it will be unnecessary to
describe these displays among the Warblers in detail,
more especially as my friend Mr. Howard has kindly
allowed me to use some of the illustrations from his book.
These show convincingly enough that the wings and tail
are made to play the same part as though they bore all
the hues of the rainbow. To bring this fact home compare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>the figures of some of these small birds clad in sober
russet and black with that of the Sun Bittern (<i>Eurypyga
helias</i>) in like mood, whose wings and tail when spread,
and only then, display bands of vivid chestnut-red,
contrasting with bands of black, on a background of grey
and buff, variegated with delicate mottlings and vermiculations
of black and brown, and streaks of white.
In the case of the Warblers, it is to be remarked, the male,
in these ecstatic moods, will commonly hold a leaf, or a
piece of stick, in his beak, as if suggesting the work of nest-building
and its delightful sequence. This, or its equivalent,
is a common phase, for the Great Crested Grebe, for
example, in these paroxysms will dive and bring up weed,
the nest material of the species, as an offering to his
mate, or as a stimulant to her yet slumbering passion.</p>

<p>It seems clear, then, that the evolution of colour is not
the stimulant to display, for this is present where conspicuous
colours are wanting. Yet it can readily be
understood how the association of ideas in regard to
colour and display arose, for there are cases where this
interpretation seems inevitable. Such are afforded by
certain sea-birds like the Kittiwake, Guillemot, Fulmar
and Cormorant, wherein the inside of the mouth is of a
lurid orange-red in the case of the first-mentioned, and
of flaming gamboge yellow in that of the others. During
moments of sexual ecstasy the mouth is widely opened,
as if to charm the beholder with its gaudy hue. Both
sexes have the same colouring, and both behave alike.
But it is doubtful whether either is conscious that its
own mouth is like that exposed to its gaze: the action
is sympathetic. No doubt it may play its part in stimulating
desire, but we cannot contend from this that it
has been evolved by sexual selection, that is to say, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>the hues have undergone a process of gradual intensification
owing to the deliberate rejection of the less gaily-coloured
suitors. The tendency to develop colour in
the mouth would appear to be latent in all birds.</p>

<p class="center">THE KAGU IN DISPLAY.</p>

<p>What is true of the Sun-Bittern is true also of the Kagu.</p></div>

<p>It is significant that whenever bright colours appear,
they do so first in the males, the females and young
retaining the dress common, up to this time, to the species
at all ages. In the majority of instances, at any rate,
it would seem that this accession of colour appears with
the seasonal re-awakening of the reproductive activities:
it forms a “nuptial” dress, and is discarded after the
breeding season is over for a livery indistinguishable
from that of the female, this forming the so-called
“winter plumage.” But if all the available facts are
taken into consideration there seems good reason to
believe that the nuptial plumage tends to be assumed
earlier and to be retained later, as this disposition to
develop ornament gathers force, till finally only the head
and neck go into “eclipse,” as in the case of the Black-cock,
Jungle-fowl and Partridge.</p>

<p>In the Pheasant we have an instance—one of hundreds—where
the resplendent dress is worn throughout the
year. The next phase in the direction of the growth
of colour occurs when the female, towards old age,
develops a more or less well marked tendency to assume
the hues of her lord, and this accession of colour makes
its appearance earlier and earlier in succeeding generations,
till finally the adults of both sexes are coloured
alike, save that, as a rule, the female lacks the intensity
of coloration which her mate displays. The original
sombre dress is now only worn by the young. In due
course the resplendent dress is assumed also by the young,
as witness the numerous instances among the Kingfishers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>and among the Parrots, where adults and young are
all habited in the same vivid hues. There are infinite
variations of these changes which cannot be discussed
here, for obvious reasons. All that matters now is the fact
of such sequences, which inevitably raise the questions:
Why, in so many cases, do the females show no disposition
to assume resplendent colours? And to what factors
can such coloration, when it occurs, be attributed? The
second only of these questions is germane to the present
discussion, and to this no very satisfactory answer can
be returned.</p>

<p>To say that the development of brilliance in species
hitherto sombrely clad is due to “changes in the metabolism”
is only an affectation of wisdom. What we
want to know is what induces the changes? Time was
when no more than a guess could be hazarded as to this:
a suggestion that ornament, of whatever kind, was one
of the many modes of the expression of that instability
of the organism which is characteristic of living things:
that it was one of the outward and visible signs of that
inward, intangible tendency to vary which is so familiar.
Later research seemed to show, fairly conclusively, that
ornament was one of those “secondary sexual characters”
which was dependent on the stimulating juices, or
“hormones,” emanating from the primary sexual glands.
To-day it is manifest that this is only partly true, for it is
certain that these glands are not alone concerned and
they may only participate indirectly. It seems to have
been clearly demonstrated that the thyroid and pituitary
glands, or the “hormones” therefrom, play a large part in
this matter of the “secondary sexual characters.”</p>

<p>Castration, it is true, profoundly affects these characters.
In the case of Deer it inhibits the growth of antlers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>in Cattle the horns are increased in length but reduced
in thickness—they are longer than those of the female,
but resemble them in appearance, and further, the whole
stature is greatly increased, but it is at the same time
conspicuously less massive, particularly at the neck and
fore-quarters. In eunuchs it results in immense stature
and the loss of the more characteristic male features, such
as the beard and the bass voice. The removal of the
testes in birds is always a difficult operation and is rarely
successfully performed. Hence the accounts of changes in
plumage consequent on this operation are inconclusive.
It has generally been supposed that whenever, either by
removal or by disease, the testes are rendered inoperative
the plumage, when normally of a resplendent type, assumes
the coloration of the female. This is probably an
erroneous supposition, but what happens is a failure to
secrete the more intense pigments and the more specialized
forms of feathers, so that the resultant dress answers
to the juvenile male dress. It is not a case of “reversion”
to this livery, but a failure to assume the latest acquirements
of the species. These, as has already been shown,
are only very gradually developed. The intensity of
pigmentation, or concentration of pigmentation, which
results in sharply defined areas of colour, is a cumulative
process. As it loses in intensity at any given moult, so
the individual tends to reproduce the phases of the earlier
and vanishing livery. Sooner or later, however, this
earlier livery disappears more or less completely: is
eliminated from the system, so to speak: and what is
commonly called lack of “vigour” results, not in a return
to the earlier, sombre dress, but in the later-acquired,
resplendent plumage lacking intensity. The seasonal,
temporary secondary sexual character has become, as
some say, a “somatic” character. Highly probable as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>this view appears, it ought, it may be argued, to receive
support from nestling plumages. Young gulls, for
example, should occasionally revert from the mottled
to the earlier striped livery. But we have no evidence
of this; and it does not follow that this sequence of
events should occur. The conditions of control are
different.</p>

<p>What exactly are the factors which govern the evolution
of resplendent plumage is not known. But they
would seem to be more complex than was supposed.
That the primary sexual glands play an important part,
through the juices or “hormones” which they liberate,
there can be no doubt but these are only partial factors.
The “hormones” of the pituitary and thyroid glands are
also necessary contributors, controlling as they do both
fertility and the more superficial characters, such as colour
and ornament. Evidence, indeed, is slowly accumulating
to show that the problem of the behaviour of animals
during the period of sexual activity, as well as the
peculiarities of structure and coloration which they
develop at this time, are all largely governed by the action
of these secretions.</p>

<p>These, in their turn, are undoubtedly inhibited, or
increased, by the control of the nervous system, though
this control is of course involuntary. This much seems
clear from the fact that birds will display when under
the excitement of fear, though the character of that
display is never the same as that in moments of sexual
exaltation. If the nervous system, through the eye, by
“suggestion,” played no part, there could be no use for
display, but it is equally certain that for the realization
of the sexual activities a number of other factors have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>to contribute.</p>

<p>The existence of this nexus of conditions is commonly
overlooked, but it is extremely important. Normally,
not only among birds, but other animals higher and lower
in the scale of life, “suggestion” does not suggest until
the “hormones” concerned with the sexual activities
have, as it were, saturated the system and rendered it,
so to speak, highly inflammable. Even then it commonly
happens that, with the male at any rate, this inflammable
state bursts into flame of its own accord. But for this,
indeed, how could the consummation—of the period of
sexual activity ever be realized? In many cases the
sexes are sundered far apart. What, but the merest
accident, could bring them together if it were not for this
consuming fire of desire which impels each sex to seek out
the other? This stage is manifested in the case of the
Deer, where, we have seen, the stag wanders far and wide
bellowing to advertise his errand and listening for a
response to his call. He is possessed by a “male-hunger”
which eventually attains to a state of frenzy. Here no
“suggestion” is needed, but the necessity for this stimulus,
for some form of aphrodisiac, occurs with him after
the first relief of his pent-up state has been attained.
This stimulus is applied, both through the eye and the
sense of smell, by the females of his herd. The same
conditions apply in the case of the birds. But it is to
be noted that with the females, as in the case of mammals,
sexual desire is commonly less intense than in the males,
and hence, in their case the need for “suggestion” by
display of some sort. But apart from this, a “display”
of some kind is necessary. How else can desire be
indicated? And here is “sexual selection.” For males,
mate-hungry as they might be, which resorted to no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>means of expressing their condition would go mateless:
and the same is true, though perhaps in less extent, with
the females; hence, then, it is clear display is a product of
sexual selection.</p>

<p>That sexual desire is less intense in the case of the
females is to be regarded as another result of this form
of selection. If they displayed the same intensity of
passion the males would speedily become exhausted,
for it is well known that the gratification of the sexual
emotions is far more enervating in the case of the male.
It may well be that polyandry has arisen from this
transference to the females, or development by the females,
of increased sexual hunger.</p>

<p>The fact that birds will repeat, albeit imperfectly, the
phases of the sexual display under the stimulus of fear,
or anger, and when no females are present, must be
regarded as an indication, for we can scarcely call it a
proof, that exaggerated movements have become the
normal concomitants of great excitement, at any rate
during the season of reproductive activity. They are
purely nervous responses to external conditions. It must
not be forgotten that, at this time, fear begets other
movements, equally striking, such as feigning lameness,
and death, which have no part in the sexual
display.</p>

<p>Interpreted in this light one can understand that to
the female not as yet sexually “ripe” or sexually
“hungry,” these movements, when not interpreted as
signs of fear or anger, fail to produce any response. So
soon, however, as this period of “ripeness” arrives, the
stimulus through the nervous system produces the desired
response, begetting a complementary stimulus through
the secretions of the sexual glands, by what we may call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>the flow of the hormones; just as the sight of food
stimulates the flow of saliva, or “makes the mouth water”
before we are conscious of feeling hungry. In due time
hunger will assert itself without the stimulus of the nervous
system through the senses. But there must in any case
be some form of display, some form of communicating
and stimulating desire between the sexes, to secure the
consummation of the reproductive acts. How else could
intimation of sex hunger be indicated and satisfied?</p>

<p>That the desire for sexual congress is inherently more
avid, more intense, in the male than in the female is often
called in question; and more especially so by those who
imagine that they have a mission to carry on “social
reforms” and to regulate the relations between the sexes
of the human race. Such aims and ambitions are
commonly those of the arrogantly ignorant. There are
few people who possess a sufficiently wide knowledge of
this theme, or of the factors which underlie it, to qualify
them to become the mentors of their fellow-men in these
matters. However much we may choose to seek refuge in
sophistry, the fact remains that man is still an animal,
and if the human race is to continue he must always
remain so.</p>

<p>A lurid light has just been shed on the fierceness of the
sexual passion in the male by Mr. Julian Huxley, who
relates some facts pregnant with meaning to all who have
understanding, in regard to what obtains among birds.
These facts are primarily concerned with the Mallard (<i>Anas
boscas</i>). This bird is ostensibly monogamous, and, on the
whole, seems to be a fairly considerate mate. The normal
period of pairing having passed, and the duties of incubation
having begun, the female ceases to harbour any
further desire for sexual intimacy. Her whole energies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>are devoted to nursing her embryonic young into life.
Not so the male. He is yet far from satiated; in him
the sexual fever still burns fiercely, but somehow he seems
never to make any attempt to provoke in his mate a like
condition, as in the days before brooding began. On
the other hand, he does not scruple to savagely pursue
every other female who ventures abroad in his neighbourhood.
So soon as a duck takes wing for a brief
relaxation from the arduous work of brooding she
is pursued by ten or a dozen already mated males, till
at last she is obliged to descend on the water, and with
her descend her pursuers, now to mob her without
mercy. Commonly at least half of these infuriated males
will eventually succeed in treading her; leaving their
victim only after she has become completely exhausted
or killed outright. This is no unusual occurrence. On
the reservoirs at Tring, where every spring from one
thousand to one thousand two hundred pairs congregate
to breed, from seven per cent, to ten per cent, of females
are annually killed in this way.</p>

<p>It is just possible, however, that an error may have
crept into these observations. One cannot help asking,
may it not be possible that these pursuing males were
actually unmated birds? The chief argument against this
is the fact that there is no sort of attempt to “display”
apparent with these birds, simply an overmastering,
ravenous desire to satisfy the craving which possesses
them.</p>

<p>Evidence is not wanting that the evolution of pigment
intensification and the consequent development of vividly
coloured liveries, or the equivalent development of ornament,
has been accompanied by an intensification of the
reproductive instincts. For there can be no doubt but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>that the display of species which are conspicuous for
their ornamentation is more animated than those of
duller hues. As an argument in favour of this view
the case of the display of the Great Crested Grebe may be
cited, wherein each sex has developed both colour
and ornament to a high degree, and are distinguishable
only to the expert.</p>

<p>The latest and the best exponent of the behaviour of
this species under the spell of sexual exaltation is Mr.
Julian Huxley, whose observations, in a condensed form,
are now to be surveyed. The most conspicuous
features in this bird are the great Elizabethan ruff of
bright chestnut and dark Vandyke brown, and the long
dark-brown tufts of feathers, or “ears,” which surmount
the head. But the satin-like sheen of the white breast
and the fore part of the neck and face add not a little
to the general effect. These ornaments are worn only
during the breeding season. So soon as the fires within
begin to burn, the parade of this finery commences, and
it would seem that a somewhat protracted dalliance
takes place before any actual pairing. During the early
phases of these performances much play is made with
ruffs and “ears.” The courting pair will frequently
face one another on the water, and go through a strange
ceremony of head-shaking. To this is soon added a sort
of ghost dance, wherein the male suddenly dives, leaving
his mate swinging excitedly from side to side. In a moment
or two, however, he appears, not suddenly, as usual, but
arising gradually out of the water. He seems to “grow”
out of the water. First his head appears, with ears and
ruff extended, and beak pointed downwards; then his
neck, and finally the body arises into view, till only the
extreme tail end remains submerged, so that he looks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>more like a penguin than a grebe! All the while he is
turning on his long axis, as it were, till he gradually displays
before his mate the dazzling white sheen of his
breast and neck, set off by the rich red chestnut and brown
of his face and frills. A moment more and both subside
into their normal attitude, shake their heads at one
another, and then proceed to feed as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>But these quaint antics are only the preliminaries to
still stranger. A pair of birds, engaged, apparently,
solely in fishing and feeding, will suddenly approach one
another and begin head-shaking, each striving to outdo
the other. Then the ears, till now erect, are thrust out
laterally, and the ruff is still further erected till it forms,
with the ears, a common disc. Then the hen dives:
immediately after down goes the cock. After some fifteen
seconds or so she appears at the surface again, speedily
followed by the cock, who breaks out about five-and-twenty
yards off. Each crouches low over the water, and each
will be seen bearing a tuft of weed in the beak. As each
sights the other a tremendous rush is made, as if they
intend to charge. But when about a yard apart each
springs up and assumes the penguin position, save that
the beak, instead of pointing downwards, is now held
horizontally and bears its burden of weed. Still approaching,
they eventually touch one another, treading the
water and swaying in a sort of ecstasy, all the while
shaking their heads from side to side. Then they
gradually settle down into the normal swimming pose,
though still keeping up the head-shaking; then this,
too, subsides, the weed is dropped, and the performers
drift apart and begin feeding. But no actual pairing
accompanies these strange performances. This final rite
is associated with a quite different ceremonial, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>witnessed more than once by Mr. Huxley. On the particular
occasion which he describes he was watching a
male swimming along near the reeds, apparently on the
look-out for something, and turning his eyes in the
direction of the course, he saw, at some distance off,
what he supposed was a dead grebe lying hunched up
in the water, with outstretched neck, and ruff and ears
depressed. Presently the male swam alongside the body
and bent down his head as if to examine it. Then he
swam to the tail end, and suddenly scrambled out of the
water on to the body; and there, with bowed head and
depressed ears and crest, he seemed to stand a moment.
Then he waddled forward over its head and into the
water. Instantly the supposed corpse raised its head
and neck, gave a sort of jump, and was swimming by the
side of its mate. They had been pairing on a half-made
nest, whose surface lay level with the water.</p>

<p>Face page 152.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Edmund Selous seems to have witnessed some
almost incredible behaviour on the part of the owners
of a nest he had under observation, inasmuch as, on
more than one occasion, he declares the male lay prone
upon the nest and the female assumed the position of the
male. After this pantomime both would leave the nest,
but commonly the female would speedily return and
pairing would be duly performed.</p>

<p>This brief summary of Mr. Huxley’s observations,
which he was generous enough to give me the privilege of
seeing in manuscript, taken in conjunction with many
other facts of a like kind given in these pages, seems to
lend support to the view that an excessive amorousness
is commonly associated with conspicuous ornamentation,
as if these stood in the relation of cause and effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, it is contended, the facts garnered during
recent years show that the theory of Sexual Selection, as
Darwin propounded it, especially in so far as birds are
concerned, is no longer tenable: but it is not an exploded
theory, it has only undergone modification. So far as the
evidence goes, it would seem that the first of the series
of events in the sexual cycle is performed by the already
avid male, when he proceeds to secure a “territory”
large enough for his needs. In insectivorous and carnivorous
species this area is fairly extensive. No other
male will be allowed within its confines. The perfection
of this instinct is vitally important, if sufficient food for
the offspring that are to be is to be assured. Where
the food is inexhaustible, as with the Auk-tribe, only a
ledge large enough to hold the egg is required. Only
avid males will develop and respond to this stimulus.
The second stage occurs with the arrival of a female
in the area. She does not at once proceed to “select”
her mate, passing on if he fails to provoke her admiration.
Her sexual condition is apparently as yet but half
awakened: to rouse this, the male supplies an aphrodisiac
in some form of display to which, in the normal course
of things, she responds, often also with some form of
display, or indication of the desire which has been aroused.
The intensity of the performance seems to vary with the
intensity of the sexual passion, which appears to be greater
in some species than others, and especially so with such
as have conspicuously ornamental plumage. There is,
indeed, a variation in the sexual appetite as there is in
the ornamentation. The two are reciprocal, and are
determined in degree by the stimulatory qualities of the
hormones of the sexual glands. Where these have been
developed in like intensity by the females, they also
display. Diminution in the quality and quantity of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>stimulating secretions of the ancillary sexual glands, the
hormones of the pituitary and thyroid, or the primary
glands—testis and ovary—decreases fertility, or induces
sterility. Where these stimulants are lacking there will
be no desire, no display, and no pairing, and consequently an
end to this defective strain. Here then is Sexual Selection.</p>

<p class="center">ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE KAGU’S “DISPLAY.”</p>

<p>Herein two birds are seen facing one another with the great head-crest fully
erected. While in this mood these birds will strut up and down with mincing gait
and drooping wings. This is a posture commonly assumed during momentary
excitement, whereas the posture shown in plate 24 is apparently only assumed
during moments of sexual excitement.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 154.</p></div>

<p>Instances of such impotency on the part of either sex
are wanting, and we can only speculate as to how such
cases would be met. Would a female who had chanced
to settle in the territory of a male whose sexual impulses
carried him no further than seizing territory remain
with him throughout the mating season, held by an
imperfectly roused, ill-defined, sexual instinct? Or,
eventually becoming mate-hungry, and failing to stimulate
him to perform his part, would she desert him and seek
another mate? On the other hand, would a male, failing
to arouse response in the female he had secured, drive her
away and supplant her?</p>

<p>In other words, are we then justified in postulating
differential effects in regard to display: a minimum of
intensity to ensure mating? A display of some sort is
essential. It may be feeble as compared with that of
another species—that of the Sparrow, for instance, compared
with that of the Peacock—but it must be sufficiently
good of its kind to effect its purpose, which is to “hustle”
up the production of offspring. A phlegmatic but virile
male, or a too feeble performer, is almost as certainly
doomed to extinction as an impotent male; for his
offspring will probably be eliminated by the adverse
conditions of existence to which their late appearance
exposed them. Where a female settles down with a
male which does not attain to the standard of display
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>characteristic of his race, it is conceivable she may sooner
or later seek a mate elsewhere, deserting the phlegmatic
bird as if under the impression that she had made the
mistake of settling down with one of her own sex. There
is no need that the female should have to “select” the
best performer of a number of males displaying at the
same time and place as a number of rivals.</p>

<p>Finally, the ornamental crests and frills, and the vivid
hues which so many birds display have not arisen, as
is generally supposed, as a direct result of the selection,
by the females, of the most vividly coloured, or ornamented,
from among a number of suitors presenting varying degrees
of intensity in ornamentation. Such “frills and furbelows”
are to be regarded as “expression points” of
internal variations in the germ-plasm, which have been
free to develop along their own lines because they have
not proved in disharmony with the conditions of the birds’
environment. Their development is to be traced to the
stimulating action of the “hormones” which control both
pigmentation and structure, as is shown by the fact that
both are modified by any interference with the glands
in question. Such ornamental features then are the
concomitants not the results of Sexual selection.</p>

<p>The development of ornament, whether of colour or
structure, may be taken then as an index of specialization,
and as one of the many manifestations of that variation
which is going on in every part of every living organism.</p>

<p>So long as the continued increments in the development
of these characters do not hamper their possessors in
the struggle for existence, they are free to go on developing.
Sexual selection, other things being equal, operates
by according the greatest number of descendants to the
most amorous, and not necessarily to those of the
brightest hues.</p>

<p>At the breeding season, in both sexes, a triangular horny plate is developed over
the eye, an oblong plate below it, while the sides of the beak become deepened
by means of larger triangular horny plates. All these embellishments are highly
coloured, and they are shed at the end of the breeding season. A further ornament
is developed at the gape, in the shape of a fleshy rosette of a bright orange colour.</p>

<p>Face page 156.]</p></div>

<p>But Sexual selection does not begin, and end, with the
evolution of frills and furbelows. “Behaviour” counts
for more than is generally supposed. This is as specific
as “structure,” that is to say, it is as constant for each
species as is its coloration, and it is also as variable. That
Evolution may be determined by variation in behaviour,
no less than through structural variations, is a possibility
which has received but little consideration at the hands
of students of Evolution.</p>

<p>The singular history of the Australian Bower-birds
lends additional support to this view, and at the same
time provides an additional argument against the
generally accepted opinion that bright colours have been
evolved by reason of the preference shown by the females
for the most vividly coloured of their suitors. For while
the males affect all the tricks and turns which are the
common accompaniment of courtship, they, in addition,
introduce very extraordinary features in the shape of
“bowers” cunningly constructed and often gaily
decorated, as will be seen presently. Eight of the total
number of species of this group exhibit this behaviour,
and while they differ very conspicuously in coloration
among themselves, they agree very closely in the type
of the bower they build. If the coloration is determined
by the female, then in this they display very different
standards, and if they do select, each according to the
standard of the species, then we must suppose that they
also must exercise a choice in regard to the character
of the bower, the favoured male being the best builder.
But why, in this case, is there not as much diversity
in the form of the bowers as in the coloration of the
feathers? A survey of the facts will perhaps make this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>point clear.</p>

<p>One of the best known of these bowers is that of the
Satin Bower-bird (<i>Ptilonorhynchus violaceus</i>). On either
side of a platform of small twigs a fence of similar
twigs is reared, sloping inwards to form a more or less
complete tunnel. At the entrance to this is placed a
platform of sticks, which is strewn with a miscellaneous
assortment of brightly coloured feathers, bleached bones,
and occasionally flowers. The work of construction is
almost entirely performed by the male: it is indeed a
little curious, having regard to the circumstances, that
the female should bear any share in its construction
at all.</p>

<p>Really this is a more wonderful piece of architecture
than would appear from the mere description of its main
features: for it represents psychical activities which are
difficult to fathom. It does not take the place of display,
but is an extension of this. During his amorous moments
the cock becomes greatly excited, chasing his mate in
and out of the bower, carrying the while, in his beak, a
brightly coloured feather or a leaf.</p>

<p>At the same time he sets all his feathers on end and
every now and then drops first one wing, then the
other, accompanying these actions with curious whistling
notes and pretences of picking up food.</p>

<p>The Regent-bird (<i>Sericulus melinus</i>) differs conspicuously
from the Satin Bower-bird, for while this is of a
uniform, deep, metallic steel-blue, the Regent-bird is jet
black, with a golden yellow crown and hind-neck and a
great blaze of golden yellow on the wing. Yet the bowers
of the two species—which belong to different genera—are
practically identical, save that brightly coloured
berries are used more frequently by the Regent-bird.</p>

<p class="center">THE “BOWER” OF THE BOWER-BIRD.</p>

<p>The “Bower” must not be confused with the nest, which is placed in a tree and
bears no sort of likeness to the bower.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 156.</p></div>

<p>The Spotted Bower-birds (<i>Chlamydodera maculata</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span><i>C. nuchalis</i>) are quite dull-coloured species save
for a vivid semicircular crest of pink and mauve
feathers which arise from the nape of the neck. Their
bowers differ from those just described in having a longer
run and for the immense quantities of shells which are
deposited at each end of the run. Some of them are
brought from long distances, as is shown by the large
number of sea shells which are to be found in the
collections made by birds living far from the sea.</p>

<p>By far the most remarkable of all are the bowers of
Newton’s Bower-bird (<i>Prionodura newtoni</i>) and the
Gardener Bower-bird (<i>Amblyornis inornata</i>). The first of
these, a native of the Mountains of Queensland, is somewhat
strikingly coloured, at any rate so far as the male
is concerned, for he is of an oil green above and has a
small yellow crest, while his breast is of a bright yellow;
the female, on the other hand, is brown above and grey
below.</p>

<p>The Gardener Bower-bird, on the other hand, is of a
sombre olive-brown, but the male boasts an enormous
crest of a flaming orange yellow. Yet, widely dissimilar
as are these two species, in the matter of their bowers
they display much in common.</p>

<p>That of the Gardener Bower-bird takes the form of a
hut-like structure of twigs, arranged around a central
support, commonly a very young sapling. As a rule the
thin stems of an orchid (<i>Dendrobium</i>) are used in the
construction of this curious hut, whose diameter is about
three feet. Before the entrance is a carpet of moss,
which is kept clear of leaves or debris of any sort, and
on this the most vividly coloured fruit, seed-pods, fungi,
and flowers are laid, being constantly replaced as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>wither. Newton’s Bower-bird, in like manner, forms
a hut around a central column: a hut which may attain
to a height of as much as six or even eight feet, and the
walls of the pyramid thus raised are generally gaily
decorated with flowers and fruit. Around the central
a number of subsidiary huts are not infrequently found,
and in and out of these the birds pursue one another in
ecstasies of excitement.</p>

<p>We have in these facts some extremely puzzling features,
which at present, at any rate, permit of no more than a
very rough analysis. Probably the whole of these bower-building
instincts have their origin in the habit, which the
males of so many birds exhibit, of carrying a leaf in the
beak when under the excitement of love-making. This
is suggestive of nest-building, and in many species this
is actually begun before the arrival of a female in the
breeding territory, while others build what are known as
“cock-nests” which are never used. Among the Bower-birds
these “cock-nests” have taken a new and more
elaborate form, and are placed on the ground instead of
in the trees, the normal site for the nest in all these birds.
Furthermore, stages in the evolution of such strange
fabrications can be found. These are furnished by the
Tooth-billed Bower-bird (<i>Scenopaeetes dentirostris</i>), the
Cat-bird (<i>Aeluredus viridus</i>) and the gorgeous Lawe’s
Bird of Paradise (<i>Parotid lawesi</i>)—which is not perhaps
a Bird of Paradise. These build no bowers, but are
content with clearing a patch of ground, of about ten
feet in diameter, on which to disport themselves. But
while the “displays” of these birds closely resemble
one another, in the matter of coloration and ornament
they present the most striking contrasts.</p>

<p class="indent f08">The Courtship of the Crocodile—Amorous Lizards—Horned Chamæleons—A
flagellating Terrapin—The Frog that would a-wooing
go—Semo musical Frogs—Some marvellous instincts in Newts.</p>

<p>The measure of the vitality of animals may be estimated
by their response to stimuli; and their behaviour increases
in variety and complexity as the nervous system develops.
Our interpretation of that behaviour commonly leaves
out of account the character of this responsiveness: we
are apt to see proof of intelligence in acts which should
be read as instinctive. And instinct is to be regarded as
a co-ordinated response to stimulus, independent of prior
experience.</p>

<p>The complexity of this response stands in very close
relation to the structural complexity of the organism
in which it occurs, and this because an ever-increasing
number of mechanisms and actions must be set in motion
to carry out the fulfilment of any given stimulus, as this
is traced from the lower to the higher groups of animals:
till at last we have to distinguish between movements
that are merely reflexes, and those which are “instinctive.”
The latter must be fulfilled by the former—the reflex
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>actions are the agents of the instinctive. Indifferent performance
in either, endangers the existence of the
individual, and in some directions of the race itself.</p>

<p>The sexual instincts, with which alone these pages are
concerned, are primarily stimulated and sustained by
internal forces, generated, as we have already seen, by the
juices of certain glands whose relation to the reproductive
system has only recently been discovered. Though not
commonly realized, and though denied by some, the
sexual instincts are the dominant factors in the animal
world. Even Man himself, the lord of Creation, knowing
good and evil, cannot escape their overmastering rule.
Commonly he is by no means inclined to rebel against
this control But there be some who, in their arrogance,
imagine that its overthrow is an end to be desired.
Having scaled some slight intellectual eminence they
fondly imagine this feat was accomplished by virtue of
some spiritual grace of their own cultivation, and call
to their fellow-men to emulate their example. But such
preceptors are labouring under a strange delusion: they
are suffering from a disease they wot not of, a “Disharmony,”
as Metschnikoff calls it, a disease which blinds
their perception of the motive power which has given
them all that they believe themselves to have created.
For these same despised instincts are the sacred fires of
our being, and when they are quenched all that makes us
human, love, ambition, and life itself will be extinguished.
If the continuance of the race be a thing to be desired
it is well that the choice should not be left to us.</p>

<p>Truisms are sometimes trite, and while it is a truism
to say that no race can continue which does not reproduce
its kind, it is more exact to say that, other things being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>equal, the race depends for its existence, primarily, on
the efficient working of the sexual instincts. In the
higher animals, the phenomena which these present are so
complex that they often assume something more than a
semblance of intelligent, purposeful behaviour. It is
therefore necessary, for their right understanding, that
they should be analysed in animals lower and lower in
the scale of life till at last we come to the very simplest
types of organisms wherein instinct can be said to play
a part.</p>

<p>The lower we descend in the scale of animal life in our
survey of behaviour during the reproductive period, the
more the evidence seems to grow in favour of the interpretation
of the Sexual selection theory adopted in these
pages—the view that neither the formal displays nor the
exaggerations of colour and ornament which so commonly
accompany them, are due to female choice; a choice not
necessarily conscious, but rather to be interpreted as the
final abandonment to the finest performer of a number of
suitors. On the contrary, this ornamentation, of whatever
kind, is the expression of an intensification of the
gland secretions which is manifested by the process of
pigment concentration and a consequent intensification
of coloration. Hand in hand with these developments
it would appear goes an exaggeration of the normal movements
which characterize the species when under the
influence of great excitement, whether of fear or pleasure.
At any rate, the displays of gaudily coloured and highly
ornamental species are commonly more striking than
those of sober hue.</p>

<p>On this rendering, the behaviour of Reptiles, Amphibia
and Fishes, is much more readily interpreted, and this is
even truer of the more lowly groups of animals such as
Spiders, Butterflies and Beetles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>Among the Reptiles, as among the birds and beasts,
the desire to obtain territory seems to be strong. But the
information to be gathered as to their behaviour in the
search for mates, and after, is exceedingly small.</p>

<p>Sluggish by nature, all become animated under the
stimulus of mate-hunger, and this is especially true of
the males. As one would have expected, from what
has just been said, desire is most demonstrative in brightly
coloured and highly ornamented species. But even the
dullest hued and most phlegmatic display quite surprising
agility and animation under the fever of Love. Thus
among the Crocodiles fierce battles are fought by rival
males for the possession of some coveted female: and
later the victor strives to dispel the apathy of his mate
by caperings most undignified in a Crocodile. He will
twist and turn, or rather twirl, round on the surface
of his chosen pool, with head and tail raised high in air,
and his capacious barrel of a body swollen out to bursting
point. These antics are performed to the accompaniment
of loud bellowings and roars heard at no other season
of the year. But more than this, an appeal is made to
the nose as well as to the eyes of his apathetic mate, for
during all this parade of love he exudes from glands in
the lower jaw, and tail, an almost overpowering smell
of musk. At last, however, these antics have their reward,
for sooner or later apathy awakens into interest, and
interest ends in desire.</p>

<p>The Crocodile is colourless, or at least is monochromatic;
not so many of the Lizards, which rival the
birds in the vividness of their hues. With the birds the
colours undergo no changes save such as are due to the
incidence of light; with the Lizards, however, the bare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>skin is exposed and this can, as it were, be made to blush
with all the colours of the rainbow. Having regard to
what has been said already as to the sources of this
coloration it is not surprising to note that here also the
males are the more vividly coloured whenever the sexes
differ in this particular. And further, it is among the
most vividly coloured males that most animated displays
take place when the endeavour is being made to excite the
amorous instincts of the females.</p>

<p>The males of the genus Sitana are very brightly garnished.
They possess a large throat pouch, coloured blue, black,
and red when expanded, and this occurs only during
moments of excitement, whether this is due to fear or
pleasure. And at the same time the vividness of the
coloration is greatly increased. No such secondary sexual
characters are present in the female.</p>

<p>A variant on the throat pouch, of a much more striking
character, is displayed by the Frilled Lizard (<i>Chlamydosaurus
kingi</i>), wherein the tongue bones have become
enormously elongated so as to project backwards on each
side of the body almost as far as the base of the tail.
With them they have carried a thin fold of skin, so that
whenever the mouth is opened these bones stand out at
right angles to the head and display a circular fold of skin
stretched as it were on rods; or they may be compared
to the ribs of an umbrella. The great Elizabethan frill
thus formed, is displayed only during moments of great
excitement, and the open mouth, at such times, is flushed
with a vivid red, which, contrasting with the teeth, gives
a very terrifying aspect to prospective enemies, and
doubtless also proves a valuable asset as a “secondary
sexual character.”</p>

<p>The display of a vividly coloured mouth during moments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>of sexual excitement, it may be remembered, occurs in
some birds. Among reptiles it is a common feature. A
good illustration of this is furnished by the Moustached
Lizard (<i>Phrynocephalus mystaceus</i>), a native of Southern
Russia. When violently excited it raises itself on its
hind legs, curls and uncurls its tail, and opens its mouth
to its widest extent, presenting, to our eyes, a quite fearsome
aspect. This effect is immensely increased by the
fact that the corners of the mouth are provided with flanges
of skin, which at this time swell up into crescentic plates,
the inner borders of which pass gradually into the rosy
lining of the mouth, thereby causing it to appear much
wider than it really is. So far this display has been witnessed
only when the animal is under the influence of
fear. But since we find that birds will make similar displays,
both when under the stimulus of fear and that of
sex, we may assume, with no little degree of certitude,
that the same applies in the case of the reptiles, for the
origin of the ornaments is almost certainly to be attributed
to the same gland secretions which produce the secondary
sexual characters of birds and beasts.</p>

<p>This, however, is no mere assumption, for we have
some positive evidence as to the association of bright
coloration with “courtship,” which has been furnished
by Mr. Annandale, a naturalist of long experience and
having a first-hand acquaintance with tropical life. He
has given us a lively description of the courtship of the
Malayan Lizard (<i>Calotes emma</i>). “The males,” he says,
“are very pugnacious, and change colour as they fight.
At the time of courtship a curious performance is gone
through by the male, the female remaining concealed in
the foliage hard by. He chooses some convenient station,
such as a banana-leaf, or the top of a fence, and advances
slowly towards the female. His colour is then pale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>yellowish flesh colour, with a conspicuous dark spot on
each of the gular pouches, which are extended to their
utmost. He stands upright, raising the fore-part of the
body as high as possible, and nodding his head up and
down. As he does so the mouth is rapidly opened and
shut, but no sound is emitted. When he is driven away,
caught, or killed, the dark spot disappears entirely from
the neck.”</p>

<p>Paring moments of excitement the Bearded Lizard opens the mouth widely displaying a vividly coloured interior.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 166</p></div>

<p>Normally sluggish, the Lizards display, it will have been
remarked, a quite surprising degree of animation when
maddened by mate-hunger. Some exhibit a considerable
degree of pugnacity. In <i>Anolis carolinensis</i>, for example,
when two males meet they face one another, bob the
head up and down two or three times, expand the throat
pouch, lash their tails from side to side, and then, worked
up to the requisite degree of fury, rush at one another,
rolling over and over and holding firmly with the teeth.
The conflict generally ends in one of the combatants
losing his tail, which is eaten by the victor.</p>

<p>The Chamæleons include among their number species
which have developed quite formidable horns, recalling
those of the Rhinoceros or, better, of the extinct
Arsinoetherium, since they are placed side by side instead
of one behind the other. In Owen’s Chamæleon there
are three such horns, two on the forehead and a median
horn on the snout, and these are borne only by the
males.</p>

<p>The marvellous play of colour which many Lizards
display is commonly attributed indifferently to “protective
coloration” and to “sexual selection.” It is
unlikely that both have played equally important parts
in their development. If the case of certain of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>Geckoes alone is taken, then there would seem to be no
doubt but that “Natural Selection” was the agent which
had determined their elaborations for protective purposes,
and in such and similar cases this may be largely true.
But the material which “Natural Selection” has worked
upon has been furnished by the secretions of the sexual
glands to which reference has so frequently been made
already. These seem to possess a very marked tendency
to contain an excitant which promotes the formation of
intense pigmentation, or an excess of tissue which may
assume the form of weapons of offence, or of excrescences
in the form of spines, or other ornamental
features. Animals in whom this tendency to pigmentation
and ornament has developed must, so to speak,
obtain a licence from “Natural Selection” if they are
to retain it. That is to say, if such ornament whenever
it appears makes the wearer conspicuous to its
enemies, or hampers it in escaping therefrom, or in
fulfilling the ordinary avocations of life, then its
further progress will be inhibited, or the wearer will
be exterminated. But the tendency to produce colour,
a by-product of the sexual gland secretions, may incidentally
serve to afford it a protective garb, and in
this event its further elaboration in the required
direction is assured.</p>

<p>In certain abnormal, sexually poisoned individuals
among the human race it is well known pleasure is derived
from flagellation. There is but one instance known to
me where this obtains as a normal accompaniment of
desire among the lower animals, and this occurs in one of
the Painted Terrapins (<i>Chrysemys picta</i>), whose finger-nails
are produced into long, whip-like ends. I had the
good fortune to witness their use one day when in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>Reptile House at the Zoological Gardens in London.</p>

<p>The unusual activity of a male of this species was the
first thing to attract attention to his movements.
Watched more closely, he was found to be dodging a
female and making frantic efforts to swim round so as
to oppose her path. This done, he closed up and
immediately commenced to apply the bastinado to her
head. The movements were so rapid that nothing more
than a blurred image of these strange whips was visible.
As soon as she escaped his attentions, he set about circumventing
her again, and again succeeded: and this most
extraordinary performance was repeated many times
during my watch.</p>

<p>Turning to the Amphibia, the descendants of that
stock which must be regarded as the ancestors of the
Reptiles, the version of the sexual rôle which is
adopted in these pages, that “Sexual Selection” in the
older, Darwinian sense, does not exist, finds further
support.</p>

<p>Among the tailless Batrachians—the Frogs and their
kind—there is no “display” immediately preceding the
act of pairing. The males seize upon the females and
hold them in a close embrace which lasts for a very prolonged
period, covering many days or even weeks, until
the extrusion of the eggs, which he impregnates by
successive emissions of the fertilizing element. What
controls the orgasm no one has yet succeeded in discovering,
but this is an important point, for it is essential
that the seminal fluid should not be emitted until the
moment the eggs are set free. The pairing act is here
purely instinctive, as is shown by the fact that if a Frog
in embrace be removed and replaced on some inanimate
body, this will be treated as though it were a female.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>With the tailed Batrachians—the Newts and Salamanders—the
male commonly executes a very animated
display which is followed by behaviour of a quite remarkable
character. The display, which is always
associated with vivid coloration, or the development
of fin-like frills along the back, takes the form of
amorous writhings and other gesticulations. At times
he will hit his mate with his snout, and at others he will
simply rub sides with her, as if to entice her to respond
to his advances. These evolutions may be followed by
an amplexus, an embrace. In some species, however,
these performances are followed by behaviour which
leaves one gasping with astonishment.</p>

<p>To begin with, there is no act of pairing, no coitus, but
the male discharges a number of conical or bell-shaped
“spermatophores,” each of which is crowned by a bunch
of spermatozoa, the male germs necessary to ensure
fertilization of the ova. These spermatophores adhere
to the bottom of the stream, and are gathered up by
the female, either directly, by placing herself in such a
position that they can be seized by the lips of the genital
opening, or by seizing the spermatophore, with its
fertilizing germs, between her hind legs and pressing it
home! The more one contemplates this extraordinary
proceeding the more one marvels at the evolution of a
departure from the normal sexual relations so inconceivably
strange. Here one sees the purpose of the
aphrodisiac in its true light. But for these facts it would
have seemed certain that its primary object was to enable
the male to relieve desire and at the same time to accomplish
its end—the fertilization of ova—without undue
waste. And this, in all the cases so far discussed, is possible
only when the female has become inflamed with a like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>desire for coitus. But here the male finds relief, without
more ado, by depositing the precious germs upon the
ground. The display then is indeed to serve as an
aphrodisiac. For the continuation of the race now rests
entirely on the female. Any defect in the orderly working
of her sexual appetite means the waste of the
spermatozoa and the failure to effect fertilization. We
cannot suppose that there is any realization of these facts,
or any deliberate action on her part, but rather that she
derives pleasurable feelings from the necessary passage of
the spermatophore, which, probably, she recognizes by its
smell.</p>

<p>The statement that the Frogs and their kind dispense
with a display requires some qualification. For in the
first place they, like their tailed relatives the Newts,
develop secondary sexual characters, but these are of
a quite peculiar kind. Among the Newt tribe, as has
been mentioned, these characters take the form of frills
and crests and vivid colours. They are intended to
stimulate through the sense of sight, and arouse emotion,
as a city is beflagged to welcome those it may delight
to honour. The Frog tribe appeal to the musical sense,
even though that music be of a barbaric kind. But, it
would seem, when once the errant females have been
drawn to the spot chosen by the males, no further
aphrodisiac is used, the male simply seizing upon the
female nearest at hand and, having once embraced her,
she is not released again until the eggs have been extruded
and fertilized. To maintain his hold, the forearm is often
excessively muscular, while one or more of the fingers
may be armed with pads. In some cases, as with the
Himalayan <i>Rana liebigi</i>, the inner side of the arm and
each side of the breast are studded with small conical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>spines. But the absence of ornament in these cases, as
with such of the Newts where there is no amorous display
before embrace, is significant.</p>

<p>And now, as touching the musical performances of
these troubadours. These commence in the early spring.
With many species, as with our Common Frog (<i>Rana
temporaria</i>) nothing more than loud croakings are attained.
But with others this “music” is enormously increased in
volume by resonators in the form of air-sacs or wind-bags.
We may surely, with some show of certainty,
liken this “music” to the song of birds, and assign its
primary purpose to the same cause—a device to advertise
their presence to wandering females seeking mates. That
birds sing after mates have been found, and later, is no
doubt due to a general feeling of “fitness,” which finds
expression in what has become the usual mode for such
emotional states. Most people must have heard the spring
concerts of our Common Frog; but these are incomparably
surpassed in volume by the Edible Frog and the Bull
Frog, which are provided with large, globular, inflatable,
air-sacs in the throat, serving as voice-resonators. Such
performances, however, are mere bawlings compared
with some other species, which mew like cats, or bark
like dogs. The most famous of all is the Brazilian
“Ferreiro” or “Smith” (<i>Hylodes faber</i>), whose voice is
one of the most characteristic sounds to be heard in
Tropical South America. “Fancy,” says Dr. Gadow,
“the noise of a mallet, slowly and regularly beaten
upon a copper plate, and you will have a pretty good
idea of the concert given generally by several individuals
at the same time and with slight variations of tone and
intensity.” When seized, the performer utters a “loud
and shrill, most startling cry, somewhat similar to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>of a wounded cat.” Another, a Paraguayan species,
<i>Phryniaxus nigricans</i>, at the breeding season, utters a
call note which consists of two clear, musical “rings,”
followed by a long descending “trill” like that of our
British Greenfinch. But, it is to be noted, both sexes
in this case perform.</p>

<p>The period of sexual activity with perhaps the majority
of animals is intermittent and extends over but a short
period annually; with others potency is continuous,
at least with the males, though desire becomes clamant
only when aroused by external stimuli. But whenever
this condition be aroused it invariably finds expression
in exaggerated movements or vocal demonstrativeness.
It uses the normal channels of expression, in short, but
intensifies them. Now this period of sexual activity
represents the maximum of “fitness” in animals, and
it is not surprising, therefore, to find that when the
barometer of vitality stands high some approach to the
maximum of activity is indicated. In many birds this
is revealed in song, though the earlier stimulating cause
is absent. Among the cold-blooded frogs the same
obtains. In the Edible Frog (<i>Rana esculenta</i>), for example,
the males, which “are great musicians,” remarks Dr.
Gadow, “go on singing for sheer enjoyment not only
during the pairing time, but throughout the months of
June and July. Warm, moonlight nights are the favourite
times for the concert, which takes place in the water,
beginning at sunset and continuing till early dawn. A
few individuals utter a single note, ‘gwarr-oo-arr’ or
‘coarx’ but these are only preliminaries. The precentor ... begins
with a sharp-sounding ‘brekeke’
and this is the signal for all the others to chime in with
the same note, varied with all sorts of other sounds, bass,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>tenor and alto, each performer filling its resounding vocal
sacs to bursting size, and these bags then look as if they
acted as floats. When there are several hundred of these
sociable creatures the din is continuous, and may be heard
more than a mile off.”</p>

<p>From what has been said of the Amphibia, and especially
of the Newts, it would seem that, among the land vertebrates
at any rate, the sexual instincts in this lowest
or simplest form are satisfied with the discharge of the
germinal products. Many, however, have advanced a
stage further and reveal the rudiments of that instinctive
care for offspring which develops to higher and higher
grades as we ascend in the animal kingdom, till at last,
in the human race, where the offspring is desired for its
own sake, we ascend to the highest plane of all. The
varied means of expression which these rudimentary
instincts take in the Amphibia have already been discussed
in “The Infancy of Animals,” which preceded
this present volume, and hence no more need be said on
this head in these pages.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br /><br />

<small><small>LOVE-MAKING AMONG FISHES</small></small></h2>

<p class="indent f08">Germinal Variations—Fishes and mate—hunting—Some remarkable
Sexual differences displayed by the Teeth of Rays—The
Double-eyed Fish—The Coloration of the Dragonet—Some
curious facts about Salmon—The strange use of the kidneys in
the Stickle-back—The Stickle-back and parental duties—Siamese
Fighting-fish.</p>

<p>Mammals, Birds, Reptiles and Amphibia, as has already
been shown, all exhibit practically the same line of
conduct in regard to their mate-hunting instincts; all use
like modes of expression. And this is a very significant
fact. It becomes more so when we turn to the fishes,
for here again we meet with the same behaviour, and
here again we meet with the same rules in “secondary
sexual characters.”</p>

<p>An instance or two of the latter distinction between
the sexes should suffice. As a rule, among fishes, the
males are smaller than the females: commonly there
is no other external distinguishing feature between them.
In many cases, however, the males are more or less
strikingly different, thereby showing a departure in the
nature of a higher degree of complexity, or “specialization,”
just as obtains among the birds. And the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>sequence to this also obtains. That is to say, as has
already been remarked in the case of the Mammals and
the Birds, the new features first appear in the males,
leaving the females and young of both sexes unmodified.
A singular illustration of this is afforded by some
of the Rays, or Skates, as they are often called. In
the Thorn-backed Ray (<i>Raia clavata</i>) the teeth of
the adult male are sharp-pointed and directed backwards,
while those of the female are broad and flat,
forming a sort of mosaic or pavement. The young male
agrees with the female in this respect. In the Common
Blue Skate (<i>Raia batis</i>) the teeth are pointed in both
sexes, though more so in the adult male. In the
Spotted Skate (<i>Raia maculata</i>) the teeth are fully
pointed in both sexes. Here, then, the normal course
in the evolution of new characters is followed, but it is
remarkable that the teeth, which are so intimately
related to the capture of food, should be thus affected.
Whether the change of teeth is associated with a change
of food, or whether neither pointed nor pavement teeth
affect the feeding, is unknown.</p>

<p>Still more remarkable is the case of the Double-eyed
Fish (<i>Anableps</i>). In this fish there is an intromittent
organ in the shape of a tube which is formed by a
continuation of the urinogenital ducts down the front
of the anal fin. In the hinder half of this organ a
bend is made either to the right or left. Out of seventeen
males, this bend was to the right in eleven, to
the left in six. Further, there is a small fleshy
tubercle at the side of the anal fin-ray, at the middle
of its length. When this prominence is on the left
side, the organ bends to the right; when it is on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>right, the bend is to the left. In the females the genital
opening is covered by a special scale, which is free on
one side, left or right, and not on the other. Thus
copulation is possible only from the side, and a left-sided
male can only conjugate with a right-sided female, and
vice versa. Here is one of the most extraordinary cases
of specialized secondary sexual characters known. How
do the sexes distinguish their complemental mates?
It is important that they should, for unions are otherwise
impossible.</p>

<p>In the Dragonet (<i>Callionymus lyra</i>) the male differs
conspicuously from the female in being much the larger—an
exception to the rule—and in having the fin-rays
enormously elongated. Further he wears a conspicuously
resplendent livery, but this is strictly a “nuptial” livery,
the colours waning as soon as the period of sexual activity
is past. That these colours play the same part as with
the birds is clear from the observations of the late Saville
Kent. “The male,” he says, “resplendent in his bridal
livery, swims leisurely round the female, who is reclining
quietly on the sand, his opercula distended, his glittering
dorsal fins erect and his every effort being concentrated
upon the endeavour to attract the attention of his mate.... The
female, at first indifferent, becomes at length
evidently dazzled by his resplendent attire and the persistency
of his wooing. She rises to meet him, the pair so—far
as is practicable with fishes—rush into each other’s
arms, and with their ventral areas closely applied, ascend
perpendicularly towards the surface of the water.” In
the course of this ascent the ova and sperms are shed,
and fertilization takes place.</p>

<p>The difficulties in the way of the study of the behaviour
of fishes during the critical period of mate-hunting are
many and obvious. Something may be inferred from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>nature of the secondary sexual characters which they
exhibit, and more definite information can be obtained
from such species as can be kept in aquariums. From
these two sources enough has been gleaned to show that
these cold-blooded creatures, in many cases, exhibit the
same emotions and the same means for their fulfilment
as the higher vertebrates. And it is significant that
wherever anything approaching what may be called
“Courtship” obtains, the males commonly exhibit
secondary sexual characters, whether in the form of
ornament or of armature; while among species which
consort in shoals during the breeding season no such distinctions
are present. The ova and milt are shed and
fertilization takes place as they escape.</p>

<p>Comment is frequently made in works on Natural
History on the fact that among fishes the males are
commonly smaller, often conspicuously so, than the
females. Among mammals the males are the larger;
but among birds this is by no means always the case. It
is somewhat surprising to find this discrepancy among
the birds of prey, where, as in the case of the Sparrow-hawk,
the male is little more than half the size of his
mate; commonly, however, there is little or no difference.
Among the fishes the differences are often much more
marked, as for example in the Conger-eel, wherein the
male never exceeds a length of two feet six inches or a
weight of one pound; females, on the other hand, may
exceed eight feet in length and attain a weight of one
hundred and twenty-eight pounds, though such giantesses
are rare, but specimens of fifty pounds and upwards
are frequently met with. The explanation of this may lie
in the fact that among fishes it is no uncommon thing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>and males becoming sexually mature long before they
have attained their full stature. With the Salmon, for
instance, ripe spermatozoa have been found in individuals
of not more than a few inches in length, and in this
species also the male is the smaller. Ova take longer
to attain maturity, for in addition to the germ-plasm
they must be provided with a more or less extensive
amount of food-material in the shape of yolk. The formation
of this is inhibited until the demands on the system
for the building up of the body have begun at least to
lessen.</p>

<p>Mate-hunger among the fishes seems generally to find
peaceable modes of expression, either in “display” or
in consorting in vast shoals, though, so far, the factors
which govern their conduct in this matter are as yet
unknown. But here, as with the higher vertebrates,
there are some species which adopt more violent methods.
A good illustration of such conduct is furnished by the
Salmon, which, during the period of sexual activity,
develops a curious modification of the lower jaw, which
is produced forwards and upwards to form a hook-shaped
projection of fibrous tissue. When the mouth is closed
this hook is received into a cavity formed within the
fore-part of the roof of the mouth. It has been described
as a weapon of offence. But this it can hardly be. On
the other hand it has been suggested that it serves to
protect the jaws when charging a rival, for the shock on
such occasions is considerable. It answers, in short,
like to the fibrous mass of tissue which protects the fore-part
of the head in Whales like the Black Whale (<i>Globicephalus</i>)
and the Bottle-nose Whale (<i>Hyperoodon</i>), serving
as a battering-ram. In the Pacific Salmon (<i>Onchorhynchus</i>)
both jaws are hooked, so that when the mouth is closed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>the hooks cross one another as in the beak of the
Crossbill. In this Salmon, too, the front teeth attain a
considerable length, while the body becomes laterally
compressed and a hump forms at the shoulders.
Little, however, seems to be known as to the nature
of their battles.</p>

<p>The combats of the Salmon of our own islands, however,
are evidently severe, and this has long been known,
for Darwin speaks of as many as three hundred, all
with one exception males, being found dead in the Tyne
during the month of June, killed by fighting. Such battles
are fought, it is to be noticed, not so much for the possession
of females—for it is a polygamous fish—as for
the privilege of fertilizing the eggs as they are shed.
The absence of a “display” here is a noticeable feature,
and it is on this account, probably, that the reproductive
period is not associated with the appearance of any form
of resplendent livery. On the contrary, the marvellous
silvery sheen which adorned both sexes on their arrival
at the spawning ground from the sea has entirely vanished
by the time that the consummation of the journey has been
attained, and in its place is naught but a slimy, dingy
copper-coloured hue. But no sooner has the reproductive
period passed than the silver lustre makes its appearance
once more.</p>

<p>These facts are the more interesting when contrasted
with what obtains among other fighting species which
must woo the females. Take the case of the common
freshwater Stickle-back. In this species the body is invested
with an armature of bony plates and spines in
place of scales, while the males are arrayed in vivid hues
of red and blue. Any survey, however, of the reproductive
activities of this little fish must take into account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>certain quite remarkable prenuptial actions and instincts.
Briefly, before the male commences his search for a mate
he constructs a nest of fine fragments of aquatic weeds,
which are held together, not by interweaving as with
birds’ nests, but by a sticky and copious secretion from
the kidneys. According to some authorities, this secretion
is to be regarded as a pathological product caused by the
undue pressure of the ripening testes. It is difficult to
accept this interpretation, for it might with as much
reason be argued that the copious secretions of the salivary
glands of the edible Swift—which builds a nest
constructed entirely of hardened saliva—are also pathological
in character. But be this as it may, the nest
completed, the male seeks a mate, or mates, for polygamy
is the rule of his tribe. In his search for these he has
constantly to do battle with other males, whom he
endeavours to disembowl by swift rushes contrived to t
rip open his rival as he passes, by means of one or other
of the erectile spines which project from his back and
belly. With the females whom he desires he uses the
arts of peaceful persuasion, swimming backwards and
forwards before her in his endeavour to excite her
amorous instincts. At last he persuades her to enter
his bower and deposit a few eggs, fertilizing them
immediately they are laid. The first to enter leaves by
forcing a passage through the opposite wall of the nest,
a happy contrivance, for thereby a current of water can
be constantly driven through, leaving fresh oxygen to
the developing eggs. One female after another is inveigled
into the bower, until the complement of eggs is complete.
These, singularly enough, are now taken charge of by the
male. He it is who creates life-sustaining currents which
bathe the eggs, by the rapid vibrations of his breast-fins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>and he it is who protects them from their most
persistent enemies—the females who laid them. As soon
as the fry appear the duties of the male are still further
increased. He must guard them from their mothers,
and other foes, and he must prevent their too extensive
wanderings. Such as stray too far afield are sucked
into the mouth and brought back again to the nursery,
where they are set at liberty by a reversal of the sucking
action. That the male of a polygamous species, and with
all the attributes of a polygamous species—pugnacity
and vivid coloration—should take upon himself the duties
which under like circumstances among the higher
vertebrates are undertaken by the female is a very
remarkable and puzzling feature. In this species, in short
the male plays successively a polygamous and a polyandrous
rôle.</p>

<p>Strange as these facts are, they are not apparently
without parallel among fishes, for certain of the labyrinth-gilled
fish present many features in common,
though as yet proof seems to be wanting. Thus the
small Siamese “Fighting Fish” (<i>Betta pugnax</i>) is endowed
with so ferocious a nature that it is kept, as the Malays
keep fighting cocks, for the amusement of native sportsmen,
two fish being pitted against one another and large
bets being made on the result. In a state of quiescence
it presents no very remarkable coloration, but if two
be brought together, or if one sees its image in a looking-glass,
it becomes thrown into a paroxysm of rage, the fins
are raised and the whole body becomes irradiated with
metallic colours of dazzling beauty. There can be no
doubt but that a like play of colour occurs during moments
of sexual excitement; it is highly probable that it is
polygamous. Of its breeding habits, however, little or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>nothing seems to be known. Not so, however, in the
case of a closely-related species, less pugnacious in disposition,
but almost as vividly coloured, in so far as the
male is concerned. Now in this species a nest of froth
is made and the eggs, after deposition therein, are
jealously guarded by the male. Hence, on these facts,
we may assume with a fair amount of certainty that the
closely-related “Fighting Fish” displays like habits.</p>

<p>That the Reptiles, Amphibia and Fishes have much in
common with one another, and with the higher vertebrates,
in the manner of their love-making is indisputable. We
find no evidence anywhere that the first faint throbbings
of the sexual pulse in the female are quickened to fever
beats after the efforts of several successive wooers, each
more demonstrative than the last, to arouse this state—the
conditions required by the Sexual Selection theory.
But successful mating depends, in each year, on the
sexual fitness of the male himself, and the mate, or mates,
which for that year he has taken “for better or worse.”
It is possible, of course, that a male, ambitious but impotent,
will be forsaken by his mate; it is possible that a
female of low sexual vitality may fail to respond to the
most impassioned displays; in either case no offspring
result, and thus the failures are eliminated. It is possible
that here, as with the higher vertebrates, coition may by
no means always be immediately preceded by display.
But the “display” has done its work. It has stimulated
the sexual appetite, as the sight of tempting food
stimulated the bodily appetite.</p>

<p>But both the Amphibia and the Fishes reveal a lower
plane of the sexual instincts, when the sexes, dominated
by some imperious instinct, gather in hordes, commingling
to shed their precious germs into the surrounding water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>there to effect the work of fertilization and the achievement
of new birth. The all-important union of these
germs is no mere work of chance, as it might seem, but
the sperms seek the ova with unerring surety, guided, in
this case, by that very efficient substitute for instinct,
chemotaxis, or the attraction which certain chemical
substances have for lowly organized living bodies. In
this case the allurement is furnished by the ova. It is
surely no unreasonable surmise that here we have the
beginnings of the complex phenomena which the earlier
chapters have revealed. On this lower plane we are
probably confronted by instinct alone, but from this
level upwards intelligence plays an increasingly important
part.</p>

<p>Not the least impressive feature met with in the study
of animal behaviour under the spell of the Sexual Instincts
is its uniformity. This fact becomes the more apparent
as one turns to the lower grades of life. Whether one
starts with the vertebrates and works downwards, or
vice versa, the same problems arise and the same interpretation
is demanded. That is to say, the theory of
“Sexual Selection” leads one to the same conclusions
whether it be tested by the evidence afforded by the
Butterflies and Moths, or that furnished by Birds or
Mammals.</p>

<p>The accessory phenomena, the vehicles which give
expression to these internal fires, are in like manner
curiously similar. These “vehicles” are the “secondary
sexual characters”—colour, and armature, and scent.
These very tangible signs are the phenomena in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>Mystery Play of Sex which first catch the attention of the
investigator. To account for these the theory of “Sexual
Selection” was first devised.</p>

<p>After the birds, probably the group most conspicuous
for its splendour is that which contains the Scale-winged
Insects or Lepidoptera, and it has always been allowed
that any explanation of the one must apply also to the
other. It seems impossible to avoid this conclusion.
But before going further it would be well to take note of
one or two interesting features in regard to coloration
that have so far not been touched upon in these pages.</p>

<p>The Coloration of Animals is generally regarded as a
by no means fortuitous feature, but one, on the contrary,
controlled and determined by various factors. Hence
are recognized various kinds of coloration: Obliterative or
Protective-resemblance Coloration; Warning Coloration;
Mimetic Coloration; and Epigamic Coloration, or the
colours associated with courtship. These various types
have been subdivided and accorded technical labels by
Professor E. B. Poulton, in his “Colours of Animals,”
but these need not be enlarged upon here. Suffice it
to say that it is generally held that all forms of coloration
can be explained, and all can be labelled, as to their
origin, with more or less certainty. There are those who
doubt the warranty for this classification. Commonly,
it must be admitted, the arguments of these sceptics
are not impressive; they are sometimes even stupid.
That such coloration, however it be labelled, is subjected
to some control seems to be shown in the case of the
Lepidoptera, for, generally, in the Butterflies, the upper
surface of the wings is much more vividly coloured than
the under surface, and this, apparently, because when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>creature is at rest the wings are brought up over the back
like the leaves of a book, so that the brightly-tinted,
and therefore conspicuous, area is concealed, as, for
example, in the “Red Admiral.” With the Moths the
wings, while the creature is at rest, are held horizontally,
and it is the upper instead of the under surface which is
exposed, but the hind-wing is covered by the fore-wing.
The coloration is here very different; for while the exposed
surfaces of the fore-wings are commonly soberly tinted,
the hind-wings may be quite glaringly coloured. These
bright colours are exposed only during flight, or during
moments of unusual excitement, as in the case of the Eyed
Hawk-moth. According to Weismann, this insect when
alarmed raises the fore-wings so as to expose the “eye-spots
“on the hind-wings, which, with the increased area
of the wings, impart a terrifying appearance to the body
to would-be assailants. This is as it may be, but for
the moment the feature to be insisted upon is that the
bright colours are almost invariably hidden when the
insect is at rest, and by quite different means, determined,
apparently, by the different carriage of the wings. Now,
according to some, bright colours are begotten by
strong light, but in the Moth and Butterfly the surface
area of the wing which is most exposed is the surface
turned to the light during rest, and this is the least
coloured. The curious relation between this coloration
and the resting position is strikingly illustrated by
the case of one of the “small Blues” (<i>Lyccenæ</i>), cited by
Weismann. Herein the male, which has the upper surface
of the wings of a bright blue, rests in the position common
to Butterflies—with the wings raised and concealing the
bright colour—while the female, which has the upper
surface of a dull brown, rests with the wings expanded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>As, however, the concealed under surface is not brightly
coloured, it is difficult to believe that these different
postures and conspicuously different colours can have
been brought into existence solely by the action of Natural
Selection, which, it is generally contended, has brought
about the extinction of those individuals which neglected,
when resting, and therefore liable to be “caught napping,”
to conceal their arresting colours. There is, indeed, no
apparent reason why the female, which has nothing to
conceal, should depart from the custom common to
Butterflies, of resting with the wings closed and raised,
this position effectively protecting the male. The facts
seem to show that the coloration of the exposed surfaces
of the wings is determined primarily by some physiological
factor rather than by the incidence of Natural
Selection directly through external agencies. Thus, for
example, the action of light on the surface of the wings
when in the resting posture may well inhibit the production
of vivid pigment owing to some inherent
physiological idiosyncrasy. But any individuals which
lack this inhibiting factor—as some species which, though
resting, are brightly coloured, appear to do—will be
eliminated, if they live in an environment harbouring
eliminating factors, which the exceptions to the rule we
must suppose do not. But on this interpretation the
fundamental factor in the determination of the coloration
is the action of light. Selection imposes a bar only to
certain types of coloration.</p>

<p>Some Butterflies and Moths, it has just been hinted,
when resting exhibit bright colours. Our “Swallow-tail”
the under surface of the wings is as brightly tinted as the
upper. Among the Moths may be cited many of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>gorgeous Atlas Moths, the Hawk Moths, the beautiful
Indian <i>Dysphania militaris</i>—wherein the whole of the
exposed surface is of a beautiful and vivid violet and
yellow—and the tropical members of the Burnet Moths,
belonging to the family Syntomidæ. In all these
cases it is not the under but the upper surface of the
fore-wings which has thus departed from the usual rule
of the tribe. Not the least remarkable feature of these
insects is the fact that while the Atlas and Hawk Moths
are crepuscular in habits, the Dysphanias and Syntomids
and Burnet Moths are diurnal, and revel in the sunlight.</p>

<p>To revert for a moment to the factors to which these
and other bright and often conspicuous hues are due.
That all highly-coloured animals are descendants of
dull-coloured ancestors there can be no room for doubt.
The vivid tints they now display are to be regarded as
due to some change in the metabolism, some clarifying
process of the organism whereby the various pigments
became segregated, concentrated and intensified. But
many of the most vivid hues are not due to pigment at all,
but to changes in the surface structure of the coloured
areas. Such are the wonderful metallic colours which
all kinds of animals display. The iridescence is due to
the breaking up of the light by reflection from finely-grooved
surfaces.</p>

<p>Whatever their nature, one still asks what is their
origin, what brought them into being. They cannot be
regarded simply as adaptations which have arisen to
meet the demands of the environment, as are the structural
peculiarities of the skeleton for example; for in this case
both sexes, and all stages of growth, should display the
same hues, and this is rarely the case. Furthermore,
we should not in this case be left with a vast assemblage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>of forms which certainly cannot be “pigeon-holed” as to
the nature of their coloration. Such, for example, as
the marine types of birds.</p>

<p>The metallic and iridescent tints to which reference has
just been made, occur among animals to which they can be
of but doubtful value, as in the Golden Mole, for example,
or the inside of the Oyster shell. Their existence in such
places well illustrates what we may call the fortuitous,
or apparently fortuitous, beginning of colour of whatever
kind, regarded from an analytical point of view. That
is to say, we are not concerned with the fact that animals
are coloured—that is inseparable from their existence; but
with why this coloration should, in some cases, assume
so conspicuous a brilliancy and vividness—a coloration
varying in its character with every species, but apparently
unchanging among the individuals of that species.</p>

<p>No answer to this, likely to find general acceptance,
seems to be forthcoming at present. But it is significant
to remark that all coloration of the kind now under consideration
has its origin, as have most other structural
characters, in the male. It is as true of coloration as of,
say, skeletal characters. One turns to the male for
what is new in the history of a species, to the female and
young for indications of past history. It is equally
true that in their coloration one finds the same sequence
of development—the male first, then the female, then
the young, till both sexes, and all stages, are once more
alike in hue. And this rule seems to apply to coloration
of all kinds—Protective—Warning—Epigamic.</p>

<p>The tendency to develop brilliant colours is associated
with some physiological diathesis with which we are not
yet acquainted. But once having started, this tendency
gathers force with each succeeding generation and continues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>to exhibit an almost kaleidoscopic capacity for
change, unless, and until, checked by Natural Selection,
whereby its further progress in any given direction may
be barred, or some other element or aspect of the coloration
may be introduced.</p>

<p>Given this controlling factor, all the various types
of coloration would seem to be interpretable. By almost
common consent, however, the resplendent coloration of
the males among many species of birds, a coloration often
apparent only during the reproductive period, and the
more conspicuous ornamentation of the males of many
other groups, higher and lower in the scale of organization,
are supposed to be governed by an entirely different
factor—female choice, or preference. The exercise of
this, it is contended, has gone on for countless generations,
and the tendency has ever been to heighten the intensity
of the ornament by the rejection of the less favoured
suitors in favour of their more resplendent rivals. Birds
and Butterflies alike are supposed to be swayed by the
same irresistible desire to mate, and mate only with
what we may call the smartest and best—groomed of their
many suitors; and these, of course, being the most
vigorous, most virile, sustain the stamina of the race and
so attain Nature’s end.</p>

<p>So long as attention was focused alone, or mainly, on
birds conspicuous for the highly ornamental character
of their plumage, this theory seemed reasonable and
probable enough, for one may admit in their courtships
an element, at least, of intelligence and keenness of perception.
But it has now been abundantly demonstrated
that the animated displays so characteristic of these gaily-bedecked
gallants, are enacted with no less persistence
and vim by species which exhibit a Quaker-like soberness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>of dress. Thus, then, the champions of the Sexual
Selection theory have been dazzled by the tinsel, and
have missed the essential elements—the physical and
psychological side of the display—the contortions,
prancings, and so on, and they have missed the even
more important element, the preliminary struggle for
territory.</p>

<p>In this new light, the gaily-bedizened individuals of the
Insect world may be surveyed afresh. The explanation of
such of their features as are commonly attributed to
Sexual Selection in terms of female choice, whereby only
the most favoured from among a crowd of suitors could
hope to succeed, may now be replaced by that which
obtains also in the case of the higher animals. It seems
to fit the facts better. One cannot understand, for
example, how, on the interpretation of Sexual Selection,
the extraordinary disparity in numbers between the
sexes of some species of Butterflies came about. Thus in
that marvellously beautiful genus Ornithoptera there is
one species (<i>O. brookiana</i>) in which the females are
excessively rare; so much so that the collector Kunstler
could only obtain fifteen females to one thousand males.
Though the males, among the Butterflies, are commonly
much more numerous than the females, the disparity is
rarely so great as with this species; but there are many
in which the proportion of males to females is as fifty
to one. As with the higher vertebrates selection affords
no explanation of this curious disproportion. Though
according to Weismann it fulfills “the first postulate in
‘Sexual Selection’ namely, that there be an unequal
number of individuals in the two sexes.” But Sexual
Selection here has a little over-reached itself, for surely
one hundred suitors seems an embarrassing number for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>an inexperienced female to have to choose from! To say
nothing of the ninety-nine males doomed to perish without
leaving offspring.</p>

<p>That the beauty of colour and form which the Lepidoptera,
and especially the diurnal Lepidoptera, or
Butterflies, exhibit is due to the choice by the females—albeit
an unconscious choice—of the most resplendent
of her suitors, that is, in other words, that she yields at
last to the most ravishing member of the crowd—there
is no evidence to show. There would seem to be no
possibility of a differential selection from among a number
of males, for there is no “display” comparable to that,
say, of birds. And what is more, it is unlikely that, if
there were, she would find anything to choose between
them, for the range of variation in, say, one hundred
males of any given species is very slight. Finally we
have no trustworthy evidence to show that the eyes of
Butterflies and Moths are sufficiently good to enable
them to make nice distinctions between slightly different
males. We have no evidence that the eyes of Insects are
capable of discriminating the details of the often intricate
patterns which their own wings, and those of their suitors,
exhibit.</p>

<p>In the matter of “Secondary Sexual Characters,”
indeed, the Lepidoptera exhibit very little difference
between the sexes. As a rule the females are larger, often
strikingly so, but in the matter of coloration they show far
less disparity. But there are exceptions to every rule.
A striking illustration of this is afforded by the genus
Ornithoptera. The butterflies of this superb group are
of huge size, and the females are larger than their consorts,
and commonly are extremely different therefrom
both in coloration and habits. In <i>Ornithoptera paradisea</i>
this disparity attains its maximum. The female, remarks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>Mr. David Sharp, “is a large, sombre creature of black,
white and grey colours, but the male is brilliant with gold
and green, and is made additionally remarkable by a long
tail of unusual form on each wing.” But a glance at the
two sexes will show that the female, though less
gorgeously arrayed, still disports a livery which is
of a highly specialized or elaborated character. How
are we to account for her differences in shape, size
and coloration on the older interpretation of Sexual
Selection? The perceptual powers, the mentality, of a
Butterfly are surely of a far lower grade than those of a
bird, or even a fish. Here, therefore, we cannot attribute
the same possibilities of response to form and colour which
we can ascribe with tolerable safety to the vertebrates.
Yet the Sexual Selection theory as generally understood
demands this.</p>

<p>So far so good. And now as to the part played by
Sexual Selection among the Lepidoptera. Darwin, in
formulating this, found its application to the Lepidoptera
a very disconcerting problem, being naturally disposed
to regard the extraordinary wealth of colour which these
insects exhibit as the outcome of a process of female
selection, in every way comparable to that which he held
to obtain among the birds. He did not postulate a conscious,
deliberate, selection; but a final abandonment
on the part of the female to the male which, by his beauty
and demonstrativeness, pleased her most. He assumed
that at this critical time she would always be surrounded
by rival suitors, offering varying if slight degrees of
difference: and, indeed, in many cases she is thus surrounded.
He remarks, in discussing the case of Butterflies:
“The males sometimes fight together in rivalry, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>many may be seen pursuing or crowding round the same
female.” But in the case of the Silk-moths—and here
is another illustration of the merciless criticism to which
he submitted his own theories—he remarks: “The females
appear not to evince the least choice in regard to their
partners.” This fact, which is certainly true in the case
of both Butterflies and Moths, and these gorgeous hues,
disconcerted him, as is shown in the passage: “Unless
the female prefer one male to another, the pairing must be
left to mere chance, and this does not appear probable.”
The facts which have come to light in regard to the
“Courtship” of Butterflies since Darwin wrote are
meagre enough, but such as have been recorded give no
support to the supposition that the females are really
influenced by, or even perceive the colours of, their mates.
Just on five-and-twenty years ago the naturalist Skertchly
published some observations on the Courtship of that
magnificent Bornean Butterfly <i>Ornithoptera brookiana</i>.
He one day came on a male sipping honey from the flowers
of a tree, vibrating its wings with the rapidity of a Hawk-moth,
and the vivid green of the wings flashing in the
sunlight, though the crimson areas thereof were invisible.
The female came “and did all the wooing.” They circled
about in flight with the female above and somewhat behind,
so that she could see, we are told, the emerald markings;
but there was no real evidence here that she was really
influenced by his coloration, and if this really were the case
then the coloration of the female equally demands an
explanation, for this, though less gorgeous than that of the
male, is far from a primitive type; on the contrary, it is of a
highly differentiated character. Furthermore, in this genus,
as has already been remarked, the males outnumber the
females by, roughly, one hundred to one. Again, Moseley,
the naturalist on the Memorable Voyage of the Challenger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>in 1872, when in the Aru Islands, was once “lucky enough
to find a flock of about a dozen males fluttering round
and mobbing a single female. They were then hovering
slowly, quite close to the ground, and were easily caught.”
But he was by no means convinced that any choice was
exerted. And he suggests “a series of experiments, in
which, in the case of highly-coloured and decorated Butterflies,
the colours should be rubbed off the wings of a few
among a number of males, or painted over of a black or
brown colour. It might be tested whether the females
would always prefer the highly-coloured ones.” Such
experiments are foredoomed to failure, for the removal
of the scales would remove the only source of communication
between the sexes.</p>

<p>Wallace, always a strenuous opponent of the Sexual
Selection theory, found in the behaviour of Butterflies
and Moths when mate-hunting a particularly powerful
countervailing weapon. He assumes that Darwin postulated
a conscious selection on the part of the female,
and with some show of reason, though it is probable
that Wallace was mistaken in this. “The weakness of
the evidence for conscious selection among these insects,”
he remarks, “is so palpable, that Mr. Darwin is
obliged to supplement it by the singularly inconclusive
argument, ‘Unless the female prefer one male to another
the pairing must be left to mere chance, and this does not
appear probable’ But he has just said, ‘The males sometimes
fight together in rivalry, and many may be seen
pursuing or crowding round the same female’ While
in the case of the Silk-moths—‘the females appear not to
evince the least choice in regard to their partners.’ Surely
the plain inference from all this is, that the males fight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>and struggle for the almost passive female, and that
the most vigorous and energetic, the strongest-winged
or the most persevering wins her. How can there be
chance in this? Natural Selection would here act, as in
birds, in perpetuating the strongest and most vigorous
males; and as these would usually be the more highly
coloured of their race, the same results would be produced
as regards the intensification and variation of colour in
the one case as the other.”</p>

<p>Commenting on Darwin’s interpretation of those cases
wherein the females are more brilliantly coloured than
the males, he insists that on his (Darwin’s) theory
“throughout the whole animal kingdom the males are
usually so ardent that they will accept any female, while
the females are coy, and choose the handsomest males,
whence it is believed the general brilliancy of males as
compared with females has arisen.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Darwin admits,” he continues, “that these bright
colours have been acquired for protection [because they
resemble those of species which from their disagreeable
taste are avoided by birds and other insect-eating enemies];
but as there is no apparent cause for the strict limitation
of the colour to the female, he believes that it has been
kept down in the male by its being unattractive to her.
This appears to me to be a supposition opposed to the
whole theory of Sexual Selection itself. For this theory
is, that minute variations of colour in the male are
attractive to the female, have always been selected, and
that thus the brilliant male colours have been produced.
But in this case he thinks that the female Butterfly had a
constant aversion to every trace of colour, even when
we must suppose it was constantly recurring during the
successive variations which resulted in such a marvellous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>change in herself. But the case admits of a much more
simple interpretation. For if we consider the fact that
the females frequent the forests where the Heliconidæ
abound [the distasteful species already referred to] while
the males fly much in the open and assemble in great
numbers with other white and yellow Butterflies on the
banks of rivers, may it not be possible that the appearance
of orange-stripes or patches would be as injurious to the
male as it was useful to the female, by making him a more
easy mark for insectivorous birds among his white companions?
This seems a more probable supposition than
the altogether hypothetical choice of the female, sometimes
exercised in favour of, and sometimes against, every
new variety of colour in her partner.”</p>

<p>Wallace’s arguments are not so crushing as he supposed
them to be, and they contribute nothing towards the
solution of the problem to be faced. But if colour played
the part which Darwin believed, and colour alone be
concerned, it is curious that the males should recognize
their mates in a guise so unlike their own. How is it
that they do not pass them by as members of the totally
different distasteful species? Whenever, indeed, the female
is more or less brightly liveried than the male, how do the
sexes recognize one another, and how, when they live
in environments so different as those referred to by
Wallace, do they find one another when possessed by
the insistent demands of the “sex-hunger” which is the
all-essential stimulant to secure the continuation of
the race?</p>

<p>The factors which assure the satisfaction of this hunger
differ in some important features from those which obtain
among the higher animals—birds, for example. In the
first place there is no necessity to find and hold territory,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>which is an imperative necessity where there are eggs to
be brooded and young to be fed. In the second, the
males, as has just been remarked, must search for the
females, often indeed, in the case of many Moths, because
they are wingless.</p>

<p>This search is conducted by the sense of smell. This
fact, familiar enough to-day to the entomologist and
the student of Evolution, was unknown to the earlier
naturalists. Neither Darwin nor Wallace suspected it.
It would have been wonderful if they had, for there is
nothing in the general appearance of these insects
which suggests an organ of smell, nor is there anything
in the structure of the nervous system which
would indicate this subtle sense. During recent years,
however, the number of workers engaged on the investigation
of the senses of animals has increased immensely,
and great strides have been made in perfecting instruments
of research. To the efforts of these workers we owe the
discovery of the seat of the scent-detecting organs and
the source of the scent. The former are furnished by
the antennæ, which lodge also the senses of taste and
touch.</p>

<p>Among the Lepidoptera these constitute important
secondary sexual characters, the antennæ, among the
Moths at any rate, presenting striking differences in male
and female. The scent-producing organs are very elusive
structures, and so far have been definitely traced, among
Butterflies, only in the males, where they are formed
by certain peculiarly modified scales known as “androconia.”
They may be either irregularly scattered over
the wing, or may form complex structures. Sometimes
they are arranged in the form of brightly-coloured,
bristle-like tufts on the hind-wings, sometimes in a fringe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>along the edge of the hind-wing. In some of the Moths
they are arranged to form a thick, glistening white felt,
which fills a folded-over portion of the edge of the hind-wing,
and in many cases “the perfume can be retained,”
Weismann remarks, “and then, by a sudden turning out
of the wing-fold, be allowed to stream forth.” In the
Ghost-moth (<i>Hepialus humuli</i>), the hind-legs of the male
have become pressed into service and have become transformed
into scent-bottles, since they are swollen and
filled with glands for the manufacture of odorous matter.</p>

<p>The naturalist Fritz Müller discovered the fact that
some of the Butterflies which haunted his Brazilian
garden exhaled a flower-like fragrance. Anyone can
test this curious trait for himself who will take the trouble
to brush his finger over the wing of a newly-caught male
Garden-White Butterfly (<i>Pieris napi</i>). The white powder
which will adhere to the finger will be found to be made
up of the wing-scales, which will exhale a delicate perfume
of lemon or balsam! Among the Moths the strong
odour of musk is exhaled by the Convolvulus Hawk-moth
(<i>Sphinx convolvuli</i>).</p>

<p>It is, however, only in the males that these odours
can be detected, and, though palpable enough to human
nostrils, their power of diffusion is apparently extremely
limited. They would seem to serve as aphrodisiacs for
the stimulation of the female, and, as a consequence,
there is no need that they should start into activity until
the male has arrived at the immediate neighbourhood
of his prospective mate.</p>

<p class="center">2, A Butterfly, Zeuxidia horsfieldi, Feld, showing tufts of scent-diffusing
scales on the hind-wings.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 200.</p></div>

<p>With the females of the Moths, however, matters are
otherwise. For the most part Moths are nocturnal, and
hence could not distinguish one another when on the
search for mates, and in many species the females
are wingless, and consequently are unable to move
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>from the immediate neighbourhood in which they
emerged from the pupal stage. In either case some
means of informing the males of the presence of females
is an imperative necessity for the continuation of the
race. This is provided by means of a subtle odour
exhaled by the females which, though imperceptible to
human nostrils, must possess an extraordinarily penetrating
power. Weismann gives an instance of this in
the case of the nocturnal Eyed Hawk-moth (<i>Smerinthus
ocellatus</i>). He placed some females, without any special
intention, in a covered vessel near an open window.
“The very next morning several males had gathered,
and were sitting on the window-sill, or on the wall of the
room close to the vessel, and by continuing the experiment
I caught, in the course of nine nights, no fewer than
forty-two males of this species, which I had never believed
to be so numerous in the gardens of the town....” To
this power of exhaling odours we may attribute the wingless
condition of many Moths, for otherwise the loss of
flight would have brought about extinction long before
any perceptible reduction in the wings had taken place.
The odour which such prisoners emit seems to possess
an irresistible attractiveness, and this fact is commonly
taken advantage of by entomologists. The Common
Vapourer Moth (<i>Orgyia antiqua</i>) affords a good illustration
of this. The female is wingless, and little more
than a pouch for eggs, but in certain seasons it is very
abundant, even in the midst of London. That experienced
entomologist Prof. Selwyn Image, in a letter to my friend
Mr. John Cooke, remarks, on this theme, that the Caterpillars
may be seen crawling by hundreds in and around
the squares, while the males may be seen flying up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>down New Oxford Street or Tottenham Court Road. If
a virgin female be put in a box placed outside the window,
within a very short space of time, often not more than
a few minutes, several males will be fluttering round
her. This device for attracting males is commonly known
as “assembling.”</p>

<p>More striking is the case of the Oak-eggar Moth
(<i>Lasiocampa quercus</i>). Mr. Richard South, in his most
useful “Moths of the British Isles,” relates that on
one occasion he had a number of pupæ in a cage
in a cottage on the edge of a moor near Lynton, North
Devon, and these attracted quite a number of males
into the room containing the precious casket, and he was
enabled to capture several. The next day he placed a
female which had meanwhile emerged, in a “roomy
chip-box, and carried it, in a satchel, to the moor, where
it was placed on the ground; the males began to arrive
soon afterwards, and some fine examples were secured.”
But the sequel is even more remarkable; for, he remarks:
“Although the female was taken on the moor only on
one occasion, that satchel continued to be an object of
interest to the male Eggars for several days afterwards.”
That this scent is capable of being transferred to foreign
objects, and of retaining its power for several days, is
a striking proof of its pungency, yet it is quite impalpable
to human nostrils! The Kentish Glory Moth (<i>Endromis
versicolor</i>) affords yet another instance of this curious
attraction by scent, the effectiveness of which is not
even lessened by exhalations of the human body, for
if a virgin female be placed in a box, and this be placed
in one’s pocket, the males will often swarm round one
and even endeavour to gain access to the box. In all
such cases the females, even when capable of flight—the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>female Vapourer is wingless—never fly until after
impregnation has taken place. Hence males with
defective scent—detecting powers inevitably fail to leave
offspring.</p>

<p>Selection, then, here lies between males of the
most active scent-detecting powers, and not between
those of the most brilliant colours. Nevertheless, both
males and females—where the females are winged—exhibit
a remarkably beautiful coloration, and this is
especially true of the Kentish Glory, wherein both sexes
wear a resplendent dress. That of the male—which is
much smaller than the female—differs in that the fore-wings
are darker, but bear the same pattern as in the
female, while the hind-wings are chestnut-red instead
of cream colour as in the female. If this scent-factor
has replaced colour as an inciting agent to pairing, then
these Moths should be of sombre hues. That such is
not the case seems sufficient to show that the colour is
not due to Sexual Selection, for it is highly improbable
that scent and colour are both of equal importance, and
this being so, one would expect to find the negligible
factor eliminated.</p>

<p>The existence, then, of bright colours in this and
other species in like case, seems to show that it
has nothing to do with Sexual Selection, directly at
any rate. The males having assembled, their presence
is probably communicated to the female by the characteristic
male odour, which is never of the same penetrating
quality as that of the female. There is no need that it
should possess this, for the females never seek their mates.
The successful male, where several rivals are competing,
is probably not simply the strongest, but he who also
disperses the right odour necessary to provoke the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>pairing response. These illustrations furnished by the
scent-hunting, scent-dispersing males and females are
of the highest importance to students of the Sexual
Selection theory, for they seem to show conclusively that
coloration plays at any rate but a minor part therein.
The importance of the scent-detecting organs is shown
in the very different types of antennæ which obtain
between male and female Moths, those of the male taking
the form of huge feather-like structures, as in some
Saturniidæ, and far exceeding those of the female in
size.</p>

<p>The methods of pairing which obtain among Butterflies
and Moths, it is not surprising to find, are very
different; for whereas in the former it takes place on
the wing, in the latter the female is always in a resting
position. Where the females are winged, long flights
are often taken for the purpose of depositing and distributing
the eggs: the flightless forms make no such
excursions. A few, as in the case of some of the <i>Psychidæ</i>
are not only wingless, but limbless and maggot-like.
They never leave the chrysalis case, but deposit their
eggs inside it. Though there is undoubtedly much that
is wonderful about the mating of these scent-distributing
species, the history of the Moths of the genus Acentrophus
is more wonderful and more mysterious still. For the
females are aquatic. The males may sometimes be
found in crowds fluttering over the surface of large but
shallow sheets of water. The females, which are wingless,
come to the surface and, like sirens, draw the males
under water, where coupling takes place; after which
they probably immediately die. But how do they
discover their submerged mates? The escape from the
water of any odour which the females may possess seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>well nigh impossible.</p>

<p>Whether display, such as birds appear to delight in
ever takes place among the Lepidoptera seems doubtful
Nevertheless, something closely akin thereto seems to
have been found in the case of certain species of Butterflies
(<i>Heliconius melpomene</i> and <i>H. rhea</i>), which have been
seen dancing in the air like gnats, and when some of
them withdrew others took their places. Again, having
regard to the fact that birds, when alarmed or excited,
will perform the display which is more or less characteristic
of periods of sexual excitement, it is possible that the
position of alarm assumed by some of the Hawk Moths
may also be used in Courtship (Fig. 1, Plate 31). But
we have no evidence on this point, and from the part
played by scent in the mating of Butterflies it seems
improbable that such displays take place.</p>

<p>A serious attempt to test the Sexual Selection theory
by experiment—to test the extent, if any, of female choice
in mating—was made some years ago by Mayer, an
American naturalist, on the large Bombycid Moth (<i>Callosamia
promethea</i>). This species exhibits striking dissimilarity
between the sexes in regard to colour and
pattern. “The females,” remarks Professor Kellog, “are
reddish brown in ground colour, while the males are
blackish, and in the two sexes the pattern is distinctly
different....” Mayer took four hundred and forty-nine
pupæ, in cocoons, of this moth and endeavoured to
discover, first of all, whether the males found the females
by sight or smell. Enclosing females in jars, some of which
were covered and some of which were uncovered, he
found that males paid no attention to females enclosed
in transparent jars so closed as to prevent the escape of
odours, while such as were enclosed in boxes or wrapped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>in cotton-wool, so as to be invisible, but yet capable of
exhaling odour, were besieged by males. To locate the
organs of scent in the female he cut off the abdomen of
several and placed the abdomens and their late owners
at some distance apart. Males came to the abdomens
and not to the thorax and wings. Males whose antennæ
were covered with shellac, photographic paste, glue,
paraffin, etc., showed no response to the female exhalations,
until the covering medium was removed.</p>

<p>Mayer next tested the selective action of the females.
He began by removing their wings and affixing to the
stumps the wings of males. The males mated with the
females quite as readily as under normal conditions,
though the most conspicuous female characters had been
exchanged for those of the male. After this he affixed
female wings upon the males, but mating took place as
usual. The females did not seem to detect anything
unusual in their suitors, nor did normal males attempt
to pair with males bearing female wings. Later he tried
the experiment of dyeing the wings of three hundred males
scarlet or green, and matched these against three hundred
which were left untouched. The disguised, dyed males
succeeded in pairing as easily as their normally-coloured
brethren. The females exhibited no choice whatever.
Hence, then, we have further reason to believe that with
the Lepidoptera scent, not sight, is the channel by which
mates are found. So far as the evidence goes, it seems
to show conclusively that in all that concerns sexual
relationships, scent is the guiding and determining factor.
By scent the females attract the males, and by scent of
another kind the males sharpen the procreative appetites
of the females.</p>

<p>If the interpretation adopted in these pages is correct,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>these manifestations and emanations of colour and scent
are readily accounted for; for they are manifestations of
inherent growth changes which, having started, are free
to go on increasing in amplitude unless, and until, checked
by natural selection. There is nothing unreasonable or
improbable in this interpretation; on the contrary, it
embraces also many other features hitherto ignored, but
no less demanding an explanation. Such, for example,
as the infinite variety of form and sculpture which the
scales of the wings and the eggs display. These are
details visible only by the aid of the microscope, but they
demand explanation as much as the more obvious
characters. Moreover they have the advantage of belonging
to a set of characters which cannot in any way influence
the choice, if choice there be, in the selection
of mates, nor are they of a nature likely to affect the
results of the struggle for existence. Of these characters,
then—the sculpturing of the egg-shell and of the scales,
the “nervation” of the wings, and coloration—we can
say no more than that they are idiosyncrasies of growth,
free to develop in any direction unless, and until, checked
by natural selection, which will speedily eliminate disharmonies
with the environment.</p>

<p>In these pages it is contended that neither brilliant
coloration nor any other form of ornamentation is
to be ascribed to the direct action of “Sexual Selection.”
That is to say, such conspicuous features have not been
dependent on the action of female choice for their survival
and development, but are rather the “expression points”
of the internal, inherent growth variations, which, not
being inimical to the welfare of the species, have been
free to pursue their development in any direction which
apparent chance may dictate.</p>

<p>The Butterflies and Moths well illustrate this in regard
to coloration, for scent, not colour, would seem to be
their principal source of information as to the outer
world. The Beetles are no less instructive; for these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>creatures, though they contain numerous highly-coloured
and some exquisitely beautiful species, are more remarkable
for their bizarre shapes, and it seems impossible to
regard these as the products of sexual selection. Yet
this is the interpretation of their origin which, in the
judgment of Darwin, we must adopt. He evidently
had misgivings as to the correctness of this view; but it
must be remembered that in reviewing the facts relating
to these lower orders of Creation he was biased by the
evidence which he had brought together in regard to the
behaviour of the higher groups under the stimulus of
sexual emotion. Convinced that female choice obtained
here, he was but following the logical result of such conclusions
in postulating the same factor wherever it could
conceivably be applied. The most formidable critic of
the Darwinian theory of Sexual Selection was Darwin
himself. The dominant ambition in all his work was to
explain his facts, not to establish his theory; and he was
convinced that his theory of Sexual Selection did achieve
that end; though there were cases where the evidence
he was analysing seemed less clear than in others. That
the Beetles presented difficulties is evident from his comments
thereon. He was puzzled by the vivid coloration
which some species present. “They may serve,” he remarks,
“as a warning or means of recognition ... as with
Beetles the colours of the two sexes are generally alike, we
have no evidence that they have been gained through sexual
selection; but this is at least possible, for they may have
been developed in one sex and then transferred to the
other; and this view is even in some degree probable in
those groups which possess other well-marked secondary
sexual characters....</p>

<p>“Some Longicorns, especially certain Prionidæ, offer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>an exception to the rule that the sexes of Beetles do not
differ in colour. Most of these insects are large and
splendidly coloured. The males of the genus Pyrodes ...
are generally redder but rather duller than the females,
the latter being coloured of a more or less splendid golden-green.
On the other hand, in one species the male is
golden-green, the female being tinted with red and purple.
In the genus Esmeralda the sexes differ so greatly in
colour that they have been ranked as distinct species:
in one species both are of a beautiful shining green, but
the male has a red thorax. On the whole, as far as I could
judge, the females of those Prionidæ in which the sexes
differ are coloured more richly than the males, and this
does not accord with the common rule in regard to colour
when acquired through sexual selection.”</p>

<p>While there is nothing very remarkable in the two sexes
being coloured alike, it is certainly strange to find the female
more brilliantly coloured than the male. And this because
among the higher vertebrates, as among the birds, the
female exceeds in brilliance only where she also plays
the rôle of wooer instead of wooed; leaving to the male
the whole responsibility of rearing the family. With
the Beetles the family has to rear itself, parental care
being limited to the right disposal of the eggs. By some
change in the character of the germ-plasm the females
may have, in these cases, acquired more “maleness,”
more of the qualities which are answerable for the secondary
sexual characters of the male, or, what seems rather to
be the case here, a result like that which has been reached
in certain of the Pigeons and Parrots has been arrived
at. That is to say, the tendency to intensification of pigment
in the female struck out a new line, instead of following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>that of the male. This rather rare form of sexual
dimorphism is also met with, it will be remembered,
among the Butterflies and Moths.</p>

<p>While brilliant colour is the more usual form of ornament
among the Beetles, there are many species wherein
the males have developed enormous horns, or have greatly
exaggerated the length of the jaws; and these outgrowths
give the impression of a formidable armature, but so far
as the evidence goes this is by no means the case.
They must therefore be relegated to the category of
“ornaments,” though the term “excrescences” would
more fittingly apply to them, for they are “ornaments”
only from a human standpoint. At any rate, there is
no evidence whatever that they serve to enhance their
possessors in the eyes of the females.</p>

<p>In relation to the Sexual Selection theory these
excrescences are of quite exceptional interest, for they
throw a strong light on the meaning of ornament, such
as obtains among birds, which seem to show a consciousness
of its existence and effectiveness. Darwin argued
from the birds to the Beetles. Convinced that the gorgeous
crests and trains and vivid colours were appreciated
by the females of the former, he was impelled to
believe that the ornaments of the latter had developed
in like case by the fostering influences of the females.
Similarly, from the evidence as to the use of horns in the
case of mammals, and spurs in the case of birds, he was
induced to believe that the horn-like outgrowths of Beetles
had been attained by like influences. But in both kinds
of cases, he could only infer their action, for he could
discover no really decisive instances of conquest either by
display or by battle, such as he was able to produce in
the case of the higher animals. Had chance directed
his attention in the beginning either to the Warblers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>among the birds, or the beetles among the insects, his
interpretation of the action of sexual selection, it is
more than probable, would have been materially different
from that developed in the “Descent of Man.” No
additions of any importance have been added to the facts
he so laboriously collected.</p>

<p>As touching the “horns” it should be remarked that
these may arise either from the head or from the thorax,
or from both, and sometimes even from the under surface
of the body.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable instances of these singular
outgrowths is that of the Hercules Beetle (<i>Dynastes
hercules</i>) of the West Indies and tropical America.
Herein the roof of the head is prolonged into a great
upturned beam bearing tooth-like prominences, and
the top of this is opposed to a still more massive beam,
whose base covers the whole roof of the thorax, and
whose tip extends far beyond that projecting from the
head. A pair of “teeth” point downwards from the
middle of this beam, whose under surface is thickly
covered with short chestnut-coloured hairs forming a
brush-like surface. In another, <i>Copris isidis</i>, the head
bears two short, rhinoceros-like horns, and the thorax
a short, triangular overhanging ledge: in <i>Phanœus jaunus</i>
there is a single horn on the head, and the thorax bears
two short, forwardly-projecting blades, one on each side;
while in <i>Onthophagus rangifer</i>—the Reindeer Beetle—the
head bears a pair of horns curiously like the antlers
of a deer. One might cite many such instances, all
varying in detail, but these will suffice.</p>

<p>Darwin, in commenting on these structures, remarked:
“The extraordinary size of the horns and their widely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>different structure in closely-allied forms indicate that
they have been formed for some purpose; but their
excessive variability in the males of the same species
leads to the inference that this purpose cannot be of a
definite nature. The horns do not show marks of friction,
as if used for any ordinary work. Some authors suppose
that as the males wander about much more than the
females, they require horns as a defence against their
enemies; but as the horns are often blunt, they do not
seem well adapted for defence. The most obvious conjecture
is that they are used by the males for fighting
together, but the males have never been observed to
fight, nor could Mr. Bates, after a careful examination
of numerous species, find any sufficient evidence, in their
mutilated or broken condition, of their having been thus
used. If the males had been habitual fighters, the size
of their bodies would probably have been increased
through sexual selection, so as to have exceeded that
of the females; but Mr. Bates, after comparing the two
sexes in above a hundred species of the Copridæ, did not
find any marked difference in this respect amongst well-developed
individuals. In Lethrus, moreover, a Beetle
belonging to the same great division of the Lamellicorns,
the males are known to fight, but are not provided with
horns, though their mandibles are much larger than
those of the female.</p>

<p>“The conclusion that horns have been acquired as
ornaments is that which best agrees with the fact of their
having been so immensely, yet not fixedly, developed—as
shown by their extreme variability in the same species
This view will at first appear extremely improbable,
but we shall ... find with many animals standing
much higher in the scale, namely, fishes, amphibians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>reptiles and birds, that various kinds of crests, knobs,
horns and combs have been developed apparently for
this sole purpose.”</p>

<p>The assumption that these “animals standing much
higher in the scale” owe their weapons to the selective
action of the females forms the crux of the whole Sexual
Selection theory in regard to the significance of ornament.
The evidence that the intensification of pigment and
the eccentricities of growth in the shape of crests and
frills have a fascinating effect on the female is more than
under suspicion; it is discredited by the facts which have
come to light in regard to behaviour during the periods
of sexual exaltation. And there is a growing conviction
that this is so. No better proof could be found that
“ornaments” can, and do, exist in spite of, rather than
because of, the action of “sexual selection.” They are
the accidents of this selection, not a part of its machinery.</p>

<p>Incipient horns are found in not a few cases among
the females of these insects, while in others, as in the
case of the Reindeer Beetle, they are almost as well
developed as in the males. This is what one would
expect to find if these outgrowths were the result of
inherent variations restrained as to their size by natural
selection, which eliminates only when this growth
penalizes, by increasing the struggle for existence.</p>

<p>As to the actual behaviour of Beetles when sexually
excited but very little information is obtainable; but
there are records of species the males of which fight
with rivals for the possession of females. Wallace saw
two males of <i>Leptorhynchus augustatus</i>, a Beetle with no
name in common speech and a long beak, “fighting
for a female, who stood close by busy at her boring.
They pushed at each other with their rostra, and clawed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>and thumped in the greatest rage.” The smaller male,
however, “soon ran away, acknowledging himself
vanquished.” In this case, it is to be noted, the
combatants lacked weapons. With the Stag Beetle it
is otherwise, and this species is said to engage in fierce
conflicts. Darwin cites an instance where two males
were enclosed with one female in a box, when the larger
severely pinched the smaller one, until he resigned his
pretensions. This being so, it is curious to find that
the female, which makes no display of pugnacity, has
the stronger jaws. The fact that there are so few records
of fighting among male Beetles, and the absence of
injury to the highly-polished surfaces of the horns or
jaws where these are conspicuously large, seem to
indicate that at most no more than a semblance of fighting
ever takes place. In a North American Stag Beetle
(<i>Lucanus elaphus</i>) the jaws, which are greatly developed,
are used, Darwin tells us, for seizing the female, but they
do not appear to be employed for this purpose in any
other species. It might be held that they play the part
of terrifying agents, as the eye-spots of Caterpillars and
adult Lepidoptera are believed to do. At any rate, they
seem to be so used in the case of a Beetle of South Chile
(<i>Chiasmognathus grantii</i>) wherein the jaws are of great
size and have their inner edges toothed. When threatened
“he faces round, opens his great jaws, and at the same
time stridulates freely.” But this parade of force is
evidently no more than “bluffing,” for Darwin, who
describes this behaviour, remarks, “the mandibles were
not strong enough to pinch my finger so as to cause
actual pain.” In the female, it may be remarked, the
jaws are quite small.</p>

<p>That too much stress has been laid upon the significance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>of the enlarged jaws and other hypertrophied
developments in the Beetles seems to be shown by
the case of certain carnivorous Beetles, of which one
species (<i>Taphroderes distortus</i>) may serve as an example.
Herein the left jaw takes the form of a long, crooked
strap-shaped outgrowth, whose purpose cannot even be
conjectured. And in this connection one may cite the
case of certain species of Homoptera—Bugs—which occur
in tropical South America. Here, in both sexes, as may
be seen in Plate 40, Fig. 4, the neck-shield is produced
backwards far beyond the body, to form a most
elaborate superstructure which appears to confound the
most ingenious attempts at interpretation.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that wherever special structures are
necessary for the performance of specific acts such as
are of vital importance to the well-being of the race,
they are developed to perfection: there is little or no
variation in their size, and no doubt as to their purpose.
Thus in many species means are necessary to enable the
male to seize and hold the female during the sexual
embrace. In the Water Beetle of our ponds and ditches
(<i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>) the male bears a very remarkable
sucker on each fore-leg, the adhesive surface of which,
under the microscope, reveals an extraordinary complexity
and wondrous beauty. This sucker forms a very conspicuous
“secondary sexual character,” and is used in
embracing his mate, whose back is deeply grooved to
enhance the hold of the suckers. In some species
punctures take the place of grooves. Suckers, like those
of <i>Dytiscus</i> are met with again in a Wasp (<i>Crabro
cribrarius</i>). In another genus of Beetles (<i>Penthe</i>) cited
by Darwin, the antennæ of the male have a few of the
middle joints dilated and their under surfaces furnished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>with a cushion of hairs to aid in the sexual embrace.</p>

<p>Beetles are creatures of solitary habits; how, then,
do they find their mates when, by the insistence of the
reproductive desires, they are driven forth to begin the
search? Though we have no direct evidence, it seems
more than probable that, as with the Butterflies and
Moths, scent furnishes their most reliable guide. At
any rate, in a large number of species, as among the
Lamellicornia, the antennæ bear leaf-like plates, which
are much more developed in the males, in which they
probably serve as scent-detecting organs.</p>

<p>In some species stridulating organs occur such as are
met with in even greater perfection among the Crickets
and Grasshoppers, and among the Spiders and Scorpions.
That these “musical-boxes” provide a means of communication
between the sexes there can be no doubt,
even if, as some contend, they are commonly used only
to frighten enemies. This purpose may well be the
explanation of their presence in the larval Stag Beetle,
for it cannot be claimed that they have any relation
to the acts of courtship at this stage of development.</p>

<p>Stridulating organs, wherever they are met with, are
fashioned on the same principle. The mechanism for sound-production
differs conspicuously from that which produces
the voice in the vertebrates. For where there are no
lungs or breathing apparatus, comparable to that of
birds and beasts, there can be no internal voice-mechanism.
Instead, the skeleton which in these creatures forms the
external surface of the body—that is to say, it encloses
the muscles, whereas in the vertebrates it is internal and
overlain by the muscles—produces the necessary sounds.
And this by means of rubbing two opposed surfaces against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>one another, one of which is ridged, the other toothed.
In the details both of position and structure a wonderful
variety will be discovered when all the known types are
surveyed, and it is possible that they perform different
functions in different groups.</p>

<p>The Locusts and Grasshoppers are among the finest
performers of these “harpists,” and it would seem that
in this group, at any rate, the music they make is of an
erotic character. In one of our native Grasshoppers
(<i>Stenobothrus melanopterus</i>) these high-pitched and
somewhat strident notes are produced by rubbing the
roughened inner surface of the hindmost thigh, which
forms the base of the great leaping leg, against one of the
libs of the wing-case which is specially enlarged and has
a sharp edge. Thereby the wing is thrown into a state of
vibration and the musical sound produced. The roughening
of the inner surface of the thigh just referred to is produced
by a row of bead-like projections whose appearance
under the microscope is depicted in the adjoining illustration.
This apparatus is well developed in the males, and
but feebly, or not at all, in the females. That the music
it produces is appreciated by the performers and their
mates there can be no doubt, for they are provided with
a special apparatus which fulfils the purpose of an ear.
In the short-horned Grasshoppers (<i>Acridiidæ</i>) this is
placed in the middle of the body just above the base
of the great thigh. It differs in the details of its
construction. In some cases it is formed by a delicate
sheet of membrane surrounded by a rim, in others the
membrane may be slightly depressed, and in some very
much so, the rim closing up to form a broad slit. Such
ears, it is to be noted, exist in both sexes, while the
stridulating organs do not. That such sound-producing
organs serve as stimulants to the sexual passions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>females is but a natural inference. Some authorities,
however, regard this as doubtful, since there are species
which appear to lack these stridulating instruments,
though possessing ears. But closer observation will
probably show that these apparently dumb species are
not really so, as Dr. David Sharp, commenting on this
fact remarks: “It is well known that sounds inaudible
to some human ears are perfectly distinct to others.
Tyndall, in his work on Sound, has illustrated this by a
fact that is of special interest from our present point of
view. ‘Crossing the Wengern Alp with a friend’ he says,
‘the grass on each side of the path swarmed with insects
which, to me, rent the air with their shrill chirruping.
My friend heard nothing of this, the Insect world lying
beyond his limit of audition!’ If human ears are so
different in their capacity for perceiving vibrations, it of
course becomes more than probable that auditory organs
so differently constituted as are those of insects from our
own may hear sounds when the best human ear can
detect nothing audible. On the whole, therefore, it would
appear most probable that the Orthoptera provided with
acoustic organs, and which we consider dumb, are not
really so, but produce sounds which we cannot hear, and
do so in some manner unknown to us. If this be the case,
it is probable that these ears are special organs for hearing
particular sounds.”</p>

<p>Certain of the Grasshoppers of Africa, known to entomologists
as Pneumorides, have undergone a most extraordinary
transformation of their bodily shape, as if in
response to the demands of these musical performances.
They have entirely lost the power of leaping, and the
abdomen, in the male, has become transformed into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>huge, pellucid, inflated bag or bladder, apparently to serve
the purpose of a resonator, increasing the volume of the
sound produced by the stridulating organ, which consists
of a series of ridges placed on each side. The noise which
this mechanism produces is, as might be supposed, considerable.
It is curious to remark that in this group
the females are more vividly coloured than the males.
In the case of one South African species—<i>Pneumora
scutellaris</i>—this coloration is so extravagant that she has
been said to look as if “got up” for a fancy-dress ball
(Plate 33, Fig. 1). Her ground colour is of a light green,
with pearly-white markings, surrounded by an edging of
magenta; the white areas are very numerous. The face
has magenta patches, and numerous, tiny, pearly-white
tubercles, each of which, when placed on a green part,
is surrounded by a ring of mauve. This scheme of
coloration distinguishes her as one of the most remarkably
coloured of insects. But to what are we to attribute
these hues? Sexual Selection will not explain them,
and it seems unreasonable to regard them either as affording
a protective or a warning coloration. They may
then, perhaps, be allowed to rank as another instance
of unchecked variation in the direction of vivid colouring,
such as has been already described as occurring both
among birds and other animals lower in the scale.</p>

<p>In the Locustidæ the ear is placed on the side of the
front leg and the rim surrounding it may either take an
oval shape or close up to form a slit. The air necessary
for the efficient action of the acoustic apparatus is admitted
through a gaping hole in the side of the body, above the
base of the leg, an arrangement not met with among
any other insects. The musical apparatus of these
insects differs from that of the Acridiidæ, for it is
formed only by the wing-cases, and not by the wing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>case and the leg. One of the wings bears a file on its inner
surface, the other, the right wing, is furnished with a sharp
edge placed on a prominent part of its inner margin.
By slightly tilting the fore-wings, or wing-cases, and
vibrating them rapidly, the edge passes under the file
and a musical sound is produced. By this means one of
our native long-horned Grasshoppers (<i>Locusta viridissima</i>)
produces a shrill, but not unpleasant, sound,
capable of being sustained continuously for a quarter of
an hour. But a species encountered by Bates during his
travels in the Amazons is a much more efficient performer.
Known by the name of Tanana by the natives, it is so
much admired by them for its singing powers that it is
kept in little cages as we keep Canaries. That these
organs are of importance to the species may be gathered
from the case of a Bulgarian long-horned or Green
Grasshopper (<i>Poecilimon affinis</i>), wherein the wings have
so degenerated as to be useless in flight, but in the male
they have been retained solely as musical instruments.
In some species both sexes have a music-producing
apparatus, but as a rule this is present only in the male.</p>

<p>That these curious and complex stridulating organs do
indeed primarily act as aphrodisiacs seems to have been
clearly demonstrated by the naturalist Bates, who, in
speaking of the European Field Cricket remarks: “The
male has been observed to place himself at the entrance
to his burrow, and stridulate until a female approaches,
when the louder notes are succeeded by a more subdued
tone, whilst the successful musician caresses with his
antennæ the mate he has won.”</p>

<p>Among the most efficient and most celebrated performers
of all on these instruments of percussion are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>the “Katydids” of North America. The sounds they
produce are said to form the words “Katy-did, O-she-did,
Katy-did-she-did.” The first of these extraordinary
concerts is heard about mid-July; by mid-August they
are in full song. By others the sounds have been likened
to those produced by the slow turning of a child’s rattle,
ending in a sudden jerk; and this prolonged rattling,
which is peculiar to the male, is always answered by a
single, sharp “chirp” or “tschick” from one or more
females, who produce the sound by a sudden upward jerk
of the wings.</p>

<p>Pride of place, however, among insect performances
of this kind must surely be awarded to the Cicadas, which
are notoriously the noisiest members of the Insect world,
far eclipsing the shrill calls of the Grasshoppers and
even of the Crickets. Darwin remarks that the noise they
made could “be plainly heard on board the <i>Beagle</i> when
anchored off Brazil at a quarter of a mile from the shore;
and Captain Hancock says it can be heard at a distance
of a mile. The Greeks formerly kept, and the Chinese
now keep, these insects in cages for the sake of their
song, so that it must be pleasing to the ears of some men.”
Only the males sing, the females being completely dumb,
and this prompted the Greek poet Xenarchus to make
the now famous remark, “Happy the Cicadas’ lives, for
they have voiceless wives.” Another naturalist, Riley,
says: “The general noise, on approaching the infested
woods, is a combination of that of a distant threshing-machine
and a distant frog-pond.” Another species,
<i>Tympanoterpes gigas</i>, also Brazilian, is said to make a
noise equal to the whistle of a locomotive: recalling
that of a nest of young snakes, or young birds, when
disturbed—a sort of scream. They can also produce a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>chirp like that of a Cricket and a very loud, shrill screech
prolonged for fifteen or twenty seconds, gradually increasing
and decreasing in force.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, no special auditory organs have yet
been discovered, and it has been suggested that these
insects do not hear in our sense of the word, but feel
rhythmical vibrations. But whether the males “sing in
rivalry,” as Dr. David Sharp suggests, is another matter.
The purpose of the “song” in the first place is no doubt
intended as a guide to the females seeking mates. But
it is quite conceivable that the call of one male may
stimulate every other male in the neighbourhood. Darwin,
commenting on this aspect of the music, gives a quotation
from Dr. Hertman, who says: “The drums are now ...
heard in all directions. This I believe to be the marital
summons from the males. Standing in thick chestnut
sprouts about as high as my head, where hundreds were
around me, I observed the females coming around the
drumming males.... This season a dwarf pear-tree
in my garden produced about fifty larvæ of <i>Cicada
pruinosa</i>; and I several times noticed the females alight
near a male while he was uttering his clanging notes.”</p>

<p>The structures, he remarks, from which these sounds
proceed, “must be ranked amongst the most remarkable
voice-organs in the animal kingdom. They are
totally different from the stridulating organs that are
found in many other insects.... Some difference of
opinion has existed as to the manner in which the
structures act, but the account given by Carlet ... will,
we believe, be found to be essentially correct.” They
are partly thoracic and partly abdominal. On examining
a male Cicada there will be seen, on the under surface,
two plates, meeting in the middle line of the body and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>overlapping the base of the abdomen. They can be
slightly moved away from the abdomen, and thereby
a wide fissure will be produced, displaying the mechanism
beneath. If the whole operculum be removed, three
membranes will be seen, an external, called the “timbal,”
an anterior folded and soft membrane, and a posterior
“mirror.” This last is a very beautiful object, tensely
stretched and pellucid, yet reflecting all the hues of the
rainbow. The sound is primarily produced by the vibrations
of the timbal, to which a muscle is attached; the
other membranes are probably also set vibrating, and the
whole skeleton helps to increase or modify the sound,
which is probably also influenced by the position of the
operculum, which varies in different species. A further
control of the tension of the air is exerted by “stigmata”
or pores, and certain air-chambers connected therewith.</p>

<p>Throughout these pages comment has been made on the
apparently “fortuitous” character of complex patterns
and structures. The “musical-box” of the Cicada affords
yet another instance. Nevertheless there is an impressive
harmony between the several parts; an interdependence
which is not fortuitous. There is obviously a nexus of
growth-controlling factors preserving harmony between
each separate part which as yet has escaped all endeavour
to discover.</p>

<p>While it is difficult to picture the initial stages of growth
of so complex an organ as that of the Cicada, the beginnings
of simpler structures such as the stridulating organs of
Beetles and Grasshoppers are more easily discernible.
“It is probable,” remarks Darwin, “that the two sexes
of many kinds of Beetles were at first enabled to find
each other by the slight shuffling noise produced by the
rubbing together of the adjoining hard parts of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>bodies; and that as those males or females which made
the greatest noise succeeded best in finding partners,
rugosities on various parts of their bodies were gradually
developed by means of sexual selection into true stridulating
organs.”</p>

<p>Structures to which we can ascribe a use are commonly
supposed to have been evolved for the purpose which we
assign to them. The “horns” of Beetles afford a case
in point; but there are many other equally remarkable
and extravagant developments among the insects which
seem to defy explanation. And they will continue to
do so until it is realized that they are but exaggerations
of the normal processes of growth, which is not limited
to definite areas but may produce extensions and
excrescences of an almost infinitely varied character. The
only controlling factor is that imposed by Natural Selection
when these growth-changes tend to impair the well-being
of the organism as a whole. Often such changes
confer benefits, giving rise to new organs, and in this
case Natural Selection encourages the new departure.
Nothing, indeed, “succeeds like success.” New departures
in one direction may be promptly suppressed, in another
they spell fortune: there is no “Socialism” in Nature.
Often these “new departures” neither help nor hinder,
and instances of this kind are commonly afforded by
“ornaments.” One of the most singular illustrations
of this kind is furnished by that extraordinary Long-horned
Grasshopper of India (<i>Schizodactylus monstrosus</i>),
wherein the wings, when at rest, have their tips coiled
up like a watch-spring, while the appendages to the legs
are scarcely less remarkable. It is a burrower, driving
long tunnels in the banks of rivers. But little is known
of its habits, save that it does not emerge from its
burrow till night, when it takes long flights. This being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>so, the bizarre character of its wings and legs is the more
difficult to explain on any Sexual Selection theory. But
regarded as spontaneous variations which have not fallen
under the ban of Natural Selection, they are somewhat
less puzzling, though, having regard to the extraordinary
transformation which the burrowing Mole-cricket and
the allied Cylindrodes have undergone, in adaptation
to fossorial habits, the legs of this insect are remarkable
indeed.</p>

<p>While there can be no doubt that the musical performances
of the Crickets and Locusts play an important
part in courtship, in some of the Long-horned Locusts,
at any rate, the males fight furiously when mate-hunting,
and to this end the head and jaws are greatly enlarged.
During the progress of the duel the wings are extended
and held erect, which is hardly what one would have
expected, since in this position they would seem to be
more exposed to danger.</p>

<p>All the insects so far surveyed have been more or less
conspicuous for their vivid hues, yet in none of these
have elaborate “displays” been recorded. To find
demonstrativeness of this kind one must turn apparently
to a group of minute, lowly organized, dull-coloured,
wingless insects with ugly misshapen heads and bodies.
The sexes do not differ in appearance, but they are
interesting on account of the sedulous court which the
males pay to the females. The late Lord Avebury, in a
Communication to the Linnean Society, remarked of them:
“It is very amusing to see these little creatures
(<i>Smynthurus luteus</i>) coquetting together. The male, which
is much smaller than the female, runs round her, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>they butt one another, standing face to face and moving
backwards and forwards like two playful lambs. Then
the female pretends to run away and the male runs after
her. With a queer appearance of anger, he gets in front
and stands facing her again; then she turns coyly round,
but he, quicker and more active, scuttles round too, and
seems to whip her with his antennæ; then for a bit they
stand face to face, play with their antennas and seem to
be all in all to one another.”</p>

<p>The Dragon-flies are among the most beautiful of
insects; they are also relatively long-lived, and they are
conspicuous. Yet this beauty must be attributed to
some inherent inward grace rather than to the æsthetic
instincts of the female. Moreover, in the matter of size
and beauty there is little to choose between the sexes;
where any difference occurs the males have the advantage.
Though the mode of copulation is well known, nothing
has been discovered as to the means whereby male and
female discover one another. It is doubtful whether
this can be done by sight, for with all the beauty of their
shimmering suits of mail and gauzy wings, their vision
is limited to a field of a few inches. Possibly scent is their
guide; at any rate, dead Dragon-flies have a vile odour.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that there are no wingless Dragon-flies,
and that none have developed unnecessary ornament
in the form of spines, horns, or frills of any kind, such as
are so commonly met with among groups of more sedentary
habits like the Phasmidæ and the Beetles, for example.
In other words, there is clearly a direct relation between
ornament and the mode of life. It is also clear that some
modes of subsistence are very inelastic, allowing of no
more than very slight structural variations, for the Dragon-flies
are an extremely ancient group. Fossil species of
large size are known from the Lower Lias, and the remains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>of a giant measuring two feet in expanse of wings has
been found in the Carboniferous. This species, however,
seems to have stood near the parting of the ways between
the May-flies and the Dragon-flies. But be this as it
may, undoubtedly Dragon-flies hovered over the backs of
sleeping Ichthyosaurs and furnished food for Pterodactyles
millions of years ago, as they now hover over lazy kine
for the sake of the flies forgathered there, or dodge to
avoid the stoop of the Hobby, and in all this vast space of
time they have not appreciably changed.</p>

<p>And what is true of the Dragon-fly is true also of the
May-fly, for it is clear that they are of the same stock.
It is true at any rate in so far as the conformation of
the body is concerned. The possibility that it may be
equally true in regard to the details of their life-history
almost staggers one, because these are, in many respects,
of a quite remarkable character. As with the Dragon-fly,
there is a prolonged period of larval life, lasting from
one to two years, which time is passed in streams and
pools where a luxuriant vegetation ensures a plentiful
supply of food. Some are carnivorous, but in the majority
of species minute plants only are eaten. More than forty
species are to be reckoned as natives of the British
Islands, the commonest being the “Green Drake” and
“Grey Drake,” beloved by the fisherman. These names
are applied, it may be mentioned, to the phase known as
the sub-imago which precedes the fully-adult stage, of
<i>Ephemera vulgata</i> and <i>E. danica</i>.</p>

<p>Save that it is curious that while the larvæ of some
species are carnivorous those of others are vegetarians,
there is nothing very remarkable about what may be
called the infantile period. But when this is ended the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>span of life remaining to them as adults is brief indeed.
Instinctively realizing that the time of transfiguration is
at hand, the erstwhile crawling grub rises to the surface of
the stream, and almost in the twinkling of an eye it mounts
into the air on gauzy wings, there for a brief space to
execute an aerial dance which in its every phase is
amazing. Some species never see the sun. They emerge
as the sky begins to redden, and as its glory fades they,
too, expire. This brief space is all that Nature has
allowed them in which to fulfil her behest to all living
things—to increase and multiply. And myriads die
without even a chance to effect this consummation of
existence.</p>

<p>The dance is a Dance of Death, and it is performed
by a host so vast as to surpass the bounds of belief save
to those who have had the good fortune to witness a scene
so amazing.</p>

<p>D’Albertis tells of a gathering which he witnessed on
the Fly River, New Guinea—for these insects have a
world-wide distribution—wherein countless myriads were
assembled. “For miles the surface of the river, from
side to side, was white with them as they hung over it
on gauzy wings; at certain moments, obeying some
mysterious signal, they would rise in the air and then
sink down anew like a fall of snow.” And in this
assemblage he estimated that there was but one female to
every five or six thousand males. It is during this flight
that the act of mating is performed. The fortunate
male from the host of rivals, in this mid-air embrace is
aided by the foremost pair of legs, which are especially
curved to effect this purpose. The embrace is momentary.
Thereafter he dies; to the female a somewhat longer span
of life remains, for she has yet to deposit her eggs, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>this being done <i>en masse</i>, she, too, expires.</p>

<p>It is curious that these creatures, which in their winged
state have never seen the sun, should be attracted by
light. But such is the case. I well remember witnessing
an instance of this years ago, while staying, one August,
at Bingen on the Rhine. Dinner was served in the open
air, and just as the soup was served May-flies in myriads
swarmed round the lamps and fell on the tables as thick
as snow-flakes. Some of these were in copula, and I
succeeded in bottling a few specimens for the British
Museum, where they still remain to remind me of this
amazing scene.</p>

<p>About three hundred species of May-flies are known, and
some enjoy a somewhat longer span of life than others.
In no case, however, do they emerge till just before sunset;
but in some species it is believed life may be prolonged
for as much as three or four days, or even longer, if the
weather be cold and wet, so as to keep them in a state
of enforced rest, which amounts to a state of coma.</p>

<p>That their hold on life during this final stage of
existence is brief there can be no gainsaying, for it is
passed fasting. Jaws are wanting, and the whole
alimentary canal has been transformed into one long air-chamber.
Its walls are now of extreme tenuity, and by
changes in the interior of the tube, valves are formed which
convert the stomach into a capacious air-sac.” When
movements,” remarks Dr. David Sharp, “tend to increase
the capacity of the body cavity then air enters into the
stomachic sac by the mouth orifice, but when muscular
contractions result in pressure on the sac they close the
orifices of its extremities by the valve-like structures
just referred to; the result is, that as the complex movements
of the body are made the stomach becomes more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>and more distended by air.” It was known even to the
old naturalists that the dancing May-fly is a sort of balloon,
but they were not acquainted with the exact mode of
inflation. Palmen says that in addition to the valve-like
arrangements we have described, the entry into the canal
is controlled by a circular muscle with which are connected
radiating muscles attached to the walls of the
head. The canal thus strangely transformed performs
the functions of a balloon, and at the same time aids the
functions of the reproductive organs.</p>

<p>Where vast numbers of individuals set out simultaneously
to achieve their nuptials there would seem
to be no need for special devices on the part of either
sex to call attention to their whereabouts. Nevertheless,
it is highly probable that the female exhales some distinctive
odour; otherwise, having regard to the fact that
she is overwhelmingly outnumbered by suitors, her discovery
in such a crowd would be impossible, and it is of
vital importance that no time should be lost in effecting
conjugation, for the time for its accomplishment is
perilously short. But there is another possible means of
discrimination—the males may distinguish the females by
the very different appearance of the head in the latter.
At any rate, this may be true of some species wherein
the males have no less than seven eyes, and these of three
different kinds! The compound eyes, characteristic of
insects, are, in these, divided, one half being set upon the
summit of a pillar raised high above the level of the head,
the other part remaining in its normal place at the side
of the head; and in front of these, on what may be called
the forehead, are three separate simple eyes, or “ocelli.”
A reference to Plate 32, Fig. 3, will make this clear.</p>

<p>That the history of the later life of the May-fly is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>remarkable no one will deny: in many respects it is
unique. Yet for all its strangeness it enables us to set
our compasses, so to speak, in regard to the phenomena
of sex in other groups. The extraordinary disparity in
the proportions between male and female, for example,
is full of significance, for it shows, as has been suggested
more than once in these pages, that, in the case of polygamous
species, we are probably in error in supposing that
the excess of females is due to the reduction in the number
of males by reason of the elimination of males by fighting.
The excess of males, or females, as the case may be, is
due to an inherent quality in the germ-plasm. The May-fly
might be regarded as an excessively polyandrous
species if the number of males in relation to females alone
be regarded: but actually it is monogamous. After a
prosaic infancy they are suddenly transformed into gay
lovers, dancing a marriage-dance. But for them is no
marriage feast, nor any later sequence of domesticity.
One in ten thousand may find a mate, and only in this
is he more fortunate than his neighbours, for, like them,
he too must die before the dawn. Theirs is not even a
sleep and a forgetting, but “one splendid hour of Life,
and then—oblivion.” It may be urged that even these
which might seem to have been fooled, have not really
lived in vain, for hosts of animals feast upon their bodies.
Myriads, indeed, are snapped up by fishes even before
they have opened their wings, while birds rudely invade
the swarms as they dance in mid-air, feasting on these
fasting ones. But this is, after all, an inglorious end,
and leaves us still asking <i>Cui bono</i>?</p>

<p>Is this amazing life-history a thing of yesterday, a
new phase, or an order of things as old as the origin of
the species, dating back some millions of years?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>So far as one can profitably speculate on such a theme
it would seem more likely to be a relatively recent innovation.
The nearly-related Alder-flies (<i>Sialidæ</i>), so well
known to anglers, seem like to meet with a similar fate,
for the female lives but for a few days only and the male
has an even briefer existence as a winged insect. The
family to which the Alder-flies belong contains a few
species which attain gigantic proportions, as, for example,
in the case of the North American members of the genus
<i>Corydalis</i>, which are giants. The males thereof are
remarkable for the fact that they are armed with enormous
jaws, which may be likened to a pair of callipers whose
limbs have been crossed. These weapons serve as claspers,
enabling the males to seize and hold the females during
the act of mating. But even here the same brief span
of life has to suffice them, for death follows swiftly on
the fulfilment of the nuptial rites.</p>

<p>The Perlidæ, or Stone-flies, which, like the Sialidæ,
are aquatic Neuroptera, the larval stages being passed
in streams, present very puzzling features in regard to
the adult males which, so far, have baffled all attempts
at solution; yet they seem to have a very important
bearing on the all-important work of reproduction.
They are among the earliest insects to appear in spring,
and possess an extraordinary power of resisting cold.
One species, <i>Capina vernalis</i>, common in the Albany
River, in Canada, frequently comes up through cracks
in the ice and casts its skin there! Another, <i>Nemoura
glacialis</i>, which appears at about the same time, actually
performs the nuptial rites in crevices in the dissolving
ice! Happily reason is denied them, or they would find
life a mockery indeed; for having attained their final
development, when the joyous and exhilarating exercise of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>flight should be theirs, they are compelled forthwith to
fulfil their reproductive functions and die—in an ice-chamber!
The males have wings which are rarely or
never unfurled; as a rule they present nothing more than
a crumpled mass of gauzy tissue, as if glued together.
Such species as attain to flight are most indifferent
performers, travelling but slowly, with laboured movements
and settling after a few yards have been traversed.</p>

<p>As a rule, among insects, where there is a difference in
the power of flight, it is the male which is superior. The
case of <i>Nemoura</i>, just referred to, affords an instance
where the contrary is the case, and Mr. J. J. Lister records
the case of one of these flies—<i>Isogenus nubecula</i>—taken
at Loch Tanna in Arran, wherein the wings of the female
were greatly reduced, while those of the male were
so much so as to be mere useless vestiges. Similar
facts have been recorded of more than one species in
Scotland, but in all such cases the phenomenon seems
to be associated with the appearance of the insect in
very early spring. In another species—<i>Nemoura trifasciata</i>—only
the front wings are reduced, the hind
pair being large enough to cover the body. In male
specimens of <i>Perla maxima</i> taken in Scotland, the wings
are so short as to be useless for the purposes of flight, yet,
in the same species taken in Central Europe, they are of
ample proportions.</p>

<p>These facts are puzzling indeed, but they seem to show
that flight is not essential to attain the ends of reproduction.
As to whether these flies secure their mates
by any kind of “courtship,” or how they find one another,
seems not to be known. But the female is remarkable
for the fact that she carries her eggs about with her,
to the number of five or six thousand, attached to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>end of the abdomen.</p>

<p>Having regard to the fact that three thousand species
of Perlidæ are known, and that they have a wide
distribution over the earth’s surface, one might have
expected that more would be known of their singular
life-history. They are, however, flies of very unattractive
appearance and great frailty, hence, save to anglers, by
whom they are esteemed as bait for trout, they attract
but little attention.</p>

“Sexual” Selection.</p>

<p>It is a curious and significant fact that in the most
brilliantly coloured of the Invertebrates—the Butterflies
and Moths—” courtship” in the sense of “wooing” is
extremely rarely met with; and this is quite contrary
to what the Sexual Selection theory of Darwin demands,
for, according to this, the colours are the result of that
selection. On the other hand, Spiders, which are for
the most part dull-coloured creatures, and the Scorpions,
which are also dull-coloured, are commonly extraordinarily
demonstrative during the early stages of
“mate-hunger.” Some practise the form of instrumental
music known as “stridulation,” others dance and indulge
in other forms of posturing.</p>

<p>In the Spiders the stridulating apparatus is formed
either between the limb-bearing portions of the body,
or “cephalothorax,” and the abdomen; between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>palps or leg-like feelers, and the jaws; or between these
feelers and the front legs. But the construction is similar
in all. In some Spiders the abdomen bears a horny
collar, which is toothed, and these teeth, as the abdomen
is raised and depressed, scrape against a number of
delicate ridges on the thorax, or “chest,” which form a
surface recalling that of a file. The grating of these opposing
surfaces against one another produces shrill rasping
or chirping sounds, which, in some cases at any rate, seem
to be designed to inform the female of the presence of a
suitor. Those who will, may examine this strange instrument
for themselves if they will take the trouble to seek
for it in one of our commonest English Spiders (<i>Steatoda
bipunctata</i>). That it serves as a sexual excitant, or as
an aid to mate-hunting, is indicated by the fact that it is
found in males only, or in a very rudimentary condition
in the female. There is a large Spider in Assam (<i>Chilobrachys
stridulatus</i>) which produces a sound like the
drawing of the back of a knife along the edge of a strong
comb; and there are others which, by the friction of
the feelers against the jaws, produce sounds like the
buzzing of bees. One of the Wolf-spiders (<i>Lycosa kochy</i>)
is known as the “purring” or “drumming” Spider from
its custom, at mating-time, of rapidly drumming on dead
leaves with its feelers. It is a wood-haunting species,
and runs hither and thither over the ground as if searching
for something, and pausing frequently to “purr.” This
singular method of producing sound recalls that of the
drumming of Woodpeckers on the hollow branches of trees,
and similarly is produced without any special mechanism.</p>

<p>That the Scorpions should possess similar stridulating
organs is only what we should expect, having regard to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>their kinship with the Spiders. In the great Rock
scorpions of India and Africa the stridulating apparatus
lies between the basal segment of the pincers and that
of the first pair of legs, and consists of a set of tubercles
and a cluster of curved, hair-tipped spines. During
moments of excitement the pincers are waved up and
down so that the spinules scrape against the tubercles,
emitting a rustling sound, which has been compared
to that produced by rubbing a stiff tooth-brush with
one’s finger-nails. In the South African <i>Opisthophthalmus</i>
the mechanism differs, consisting of leaf-like hairs placed
on the inner surface of the jaws. But since both sexes
possess these strange sound-producing mechanisms it
has been suggested that their main, if not their only
purpose, is to serve as a warning to enemies to keep their
distance. Some of the great bird-eating Spiders
(<i>Aviculariidæ</i>) produce a kind of whistle; others, sounds
like the dropping of shot upon a plate.</p>

<p>These stridulating contrivances present some curious
and puzzling features. In the first place the sounds they
produce are never loud to human ears; therein they
differ from the shrill piercing sounds produced by like
mechanism by the Crickets and Grasshoppers, though
even with some of these the notes are, to us, inaudible.
In the second, it has been suggested that where both
sexes possess a stridulating apparatus its purpose is
solely to warn off enemies, and this because the performers
have no sense of hearing, and are thus, we presume,
unaware of the sounds they produce. There is something
unsatisfactory about this line of argument. There
seems to be no evidence either that the sounds produced
are loud enough to terrify an enemy, or that the performers
are really deaf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>In cases where the males alone stridulate it is always
supposed that this “music” serves the purpose of a
lure, or acts as an excitant, to the female, even though
inaudible to human ears. But there are many people
who are unable to hear the shrill squeal of our native
bats. Yet no one doubts but that all bats hear it.
The argument as to the absence of any sense of hearing
in certain Spiders is based on their failure to respond to
the vibrations of a tuning-fork, but this evidence is not
conclusive. Neither is it safe to infer that the presence
of stridulating organs in the adult and immature stages
of both sexes, in some species, precludes their recognition
as secondary sexual characters. They may serve the
double purpose of sexual excitants and terrifying enemies,
their motive being expressed by the quality of the sound
as certainly as the timbre of the human voice may express
rage or pleasure.</p>

<p>Neither Spiders nor Scorpions exhibit any very striking
secondary sexual characters. As a rule the female is the
larger, often strikingly so. Bright colours are rare, and
are met with only among the Spiders, wherein sometimes
the male, sometimes the female, is the more resplendent;
where bright colours—apple-green, red and yellow—do
occur, they seem rather to be of the type known as Anti-cryptic,
or aggressive resemblance colours. That is to say,
they are hues developed to deceive prey by reason of
the likeness they afford the wearer to its surroundings.
Thus, for example, one of our native Spiders (<i>Tibellus
oblongus</i>) is straw-coloured, and has an elongated body,
which is therefore seen with difficulty amid dry grass
and rushes which are the haunts of the species. <i>Misumena
vatia</i>, one of the Crab-spiders, resembles the flowers on
which it is accustomed to lurk for its prey. It is of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>variable hue, commonly yellow or pink, and a favoured
lurking-place is near the blooms of the great mullein
(<i>Verbascum thapsus</i>), where it seizes upon bees coming
for honey. Exotic relatives of this species afford far
more striking illustrations of this kind. One has a pink,
three-lobed body which bears a striking likeness to a
withered flower, and it exhales a sweet odour of jasmine.
Insects attracted by the smell are thus readily pounced
upon. Dr. Trimen, of Cape Town, describes a rose-red
species which exactly matches an oleander flower, and to
complete the deception the abdomen is marked with
white. The same observer, approaching a bush of the
yellow-flowered <i>Senecio pubigera</i>, noticed that two of the
numerous butterflies settled upon it did not fly away
with their companions. Each of these he found to be
in the clutches of a spider whose remarkable resemblance
to the flower lay not only in its colour, but in the
attitude it assumed. “Holding on to the flower-stalk
by the two hinder pairs of legs, it extended the two
long front pairs upwards and laterally. In this position
it was scarcely possible to believe that it was not
a flower seen in profile, the rounded abdomen representing
the central mass of florets, and the extended
legs the ray florets; while to complete the illusion the
femora of the front pair of legs, addressed to the thorax,
have each a longitudinal red stripe which represents the
ferruginous stripe on the sepals of the flower.” But
more remarkable still is the case cited by my friend Dr.
H. O. Forbes. This came under his notice while butterfly hunting
in Java. The butterflies of the family
<i>Hesperidæ</i> have a habit of settling on the excreta of
birds. Forbes noticed one on a leaf apparently enjoying
a feast. Creeping up, he seized hold of this victim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>of a depraved taste and found it mysteriously held down.
On further examination of this “excreta” he found that
it was really a spider! Later, when in Sumatra, the same
species once more in like manner deceived him. The
deception is more than usually remarkable, for it is not
due to the coloration of the body, but to what may almost
be described as a diabolically ingenious display of intelligence.
For the creature weaves upon a leaf a small
white patch of web exactly resembling the fluid excrement
of a bird sliding down the smooth surface of the
leaf. Having completed this, the weaver lies on its back
in the middle of the web holding on by the spines with
which the legs are furnished. It then awaits its victim
with the disengaged portions of the legs ready to close in
a deadly embrace the moment the lure has done its work.
Though somewhat in the nature of a digression, these
facts show that colour often plays a vital part in well-being;
though in the matter of courtship its rôle has
probably been overestimated. Colour as an aid to “mate hunting
“probably nowhere plays so important a part as
was at one time believed. The Warblers among the birds,
and the Spiders among more lowly animals, seem to
demonstrate this fact.</p>

<p>The actual mating of Spiders, the act of coition, is
peculiar, and demands notice, for the orgasm is not
accomplished at the moment of the ejection of the sexual
products. The male discharges the seminal fluid upon
a small web woven for the purpose, and the liberated
spermatozoa are then sucked up into a tube—the
<i>receptaculum seminis</i>—which lies coiled up within a hollow
bulb attached to the base of the last joint of the leg-like
feeler, or “pedipalp” at the base of the head. The
precious fluid is there stored and retained until the
moment arrives when these palps can be thrust into die
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>genital aperture of the female, and their contents discharged
for the second and last time. This is the critical
moment of the Spider’s life, and it is noteworthy that it
should occur now, instead of at the moment of the discharge
from the body. The ejection from the palpal
organ is effected by means of a fibro-elastic bag, in its
normal, collapsed, state spirally disposed round the base
of the bulb which contains the sperm tube. Immediately
preceding copulation this elastic bag or “hæmatodocha”
becomes turgid with blood, and it is probably the pressure
thus exerted on its base which affords the final fury of
desire without which, indeed, one might well imagine the
necessary courage for copulation would never be raised,
at any rate, in the case of some species.</p>

<p>Strange as these facts are, the nice adjustment of
the instincts for their effectual performance is, by
comparison, stranger still. By what subtle sense is the
male Spider informed of the importance of the fertilizing
fluid which escapes his body? What prompts him before
its escape to prepare a web for its reception? What
prompts him after its deposition to collect it within
the palp till it shall be needed? The least defect in the
instincts appertaining to these vitally important acts
would mean the extinction of the race. We cannot
suppose that the nature of their performance is in any
way realized by the performer, and this makes their
orderly execution the more wonderful.</p>

<p class="center">MALE ICIUS DISPLAYING.</p>

<p>The “courtship” of the male spider takes the form of a “display” recalling that
of birds. He commonly ends in being eaten by his mate.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 242.</p></div>

<p>Our knowledge of Spiders under the afflatus of sexual
desire has been immensely increased by the long and
patient observations of Mr. and Mrs. Peckham. The fact
that their investigations were carried on with captive specimens,
and therefore under artificial conditions both as
to environment and the number of individuals placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>together at one time, must not be lost sight of; nor must
we forget that they worked under the firm conviction
that the Sexual Selection theory of choice by the females
was an indisputable fact. Wherever colour was present
they looked for, and saw, evidence that the female
appreciated such hues, though from their observations it
would seem that dull-coloured species behaved as though
they were suffused with resplendent hues. In the course
of their studies the courtship of several species was investigated,
but a summary of their results is all that can
be given here. <i>Saitis pulex</i> formed the subject of one of
their experiments. A male was placed in a box containing
a mature female. “He saw her as she stood
perfectly still, twelve inches away; the glance seemed to
excite him and he moved towards her; when some four
inches from her he stood still, and then began the most
remarkable performance that an amorous male could
offer to an admiring female. She eyed him eagerly,
changing her position from time to time so that he might
be always in view. He, raising his whole body on one
side by straightening out the legs, and lowering it on the
other by folding the first two pairs of legs up and under,
leans so far over as to be in danger of losing his balance,
which he only maintains by sidling rapidly towards
the lowered side. The palpus, too, on this side was
turned back to correspond to the direction of the legs
nearest to it. He moved in a semicircle for about two
inches, and then instantly reversed the position of the
legs and circled in the opposite direction, gradually
approaching nearer and nearer to the female. Now she
dashes towards him, while he, raising his first pair of
legs, extends them upwards and forwards as if to hold
her off, but withal slowly retreats. Again and again he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>circles from side to side, she gazing towards him in a
softer mood, evidently admiring the grace of his antics.
This is repeated until we have counted one hundred
and eleven circles made by the ardent little male.
Now he approaches nearer and nearer, and when
almost within reach whirls madly around and around
her, she joining and whirling with him in a giddy
maze. Again he falls back and resumes his semicircular
motions with his body tilted over; she, all
excitement, lowers her head and raises her body so that it
is almost vertical; both draw nearer; she moves slowly
under him, he crawling over her head, and the mating is
accomplished. After they have paired once the preliminary
courtship is not so long. On one occasion a
female was the more eager of the two, but this is evidently
very exceptional. The female always watches the antics
of the male intently, but often refuses him in the end,
even after dancing before her for a long time.”</p>

<p>Of another species—<i>Epiblemum scenicum</i>—they write:
“The females seemed to have some difficulty in choosing
from among the males, but after a decision has been
reached and a male accepted, there appeared to be complete
agreement.” A species of the genus Iritis, which
seems to have baffled identification, was watched for hours
under natural conditions as well as in confinement.” A
dozen or more males, and about half as many females,
were assembled together within the length of one of the
rails. The males were rushing hither and thither, dancing
opposite now one female, now another; often two males
met each other, when a short passage of arms followed.
They waved their first legs, sidled back and forth, and
then rushed together and clinched, but quickly separated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>neither being hurt, only to run off in search of fairer foes.”</p>

<p>These most patient observers seem to have been convinced
that whenever Spiders possess vividly coloured
areas on their bodies they are not only conscious of this
fact, but desire to make the most of such splendour
during the period of love-making. Thus they interpret
the behaviour of a curiously ant-like Spider—<i>Synageles
picata</i>—which has the first pair of legs especially
thickened, flattened on the anterior surface, and of a
highly iridescent steel-blue colour. As he approaches
the female he pauses “every few moments to rock from
side to side, and to bend his brilliant legs so that she
may look full at them; ... he could not have chosen
a better position than the one he took to make a display.”
And similarly they interpret the movements of another
species—<i>Dendryphantes capitatus</i>—which has a bronze-brown
face, rendered conspicuous by snow-white bands.
The attitude he assumes when sexually excited is one
which seems, to them at any rate, to serve admirably
to expose this feature to the watchful female. But he
has other charms, and his “antics are repeated for a
very long time, often for hours; when at last, the female,
either won by his beauty or worn out by his persistence,
accepts his addresses.” <i>Habrocestum splendens</i>—unhappily
these creatures have no names in common speech—possesses an abdomen of a magnificent purplish red, and
the attitude which he assumes at courtship they regard
as one designed to display this to the full. Another
case of quite remarkable interest is that of <i>Astia vittata</i>,
because the males appear to be dimorphic. That is
to say, they appear under two quite distinct forms, the
one red, like the female; and the other black, with three
tufts of hair just behind the head. The attitudes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>the movements of courtship, it is significant to remark,
are entirely different in the two varieties: the black
form, assumed to be the later development, “is much
the more lively of the two, and whenever the varieties
were seen to compete for a female, the black one was
successful.”</p>

<p>Professor Poulton, commenting on this particular
case, contends that “it must be admitted that these
facts afford the <i>strongest support</i> to the theory of Sexual
Selection.” But do they? A further examination
of the facts will probably show that the red “form”
is but an immature example, and this being so, the
difference in performance and the invariable success of
Othello is at once accounted for. The fact that the
“two forms pass into each other” and that the “tufts
only occur in the fully developed <i>niger</i> form” is an
additional reason for regarding the red form as immature.</p>

<p>Professor Poulton remarks: “When the males possess
any special adornment they make a point of displaying
them as fully as possible.” If this be so it seems to be
a very foolhardy proceeding, akin to holding the proverbial
“red rag” to a bull: for it is well known that
the male Spider seeking a mate carries his life in his
hands, at any rate in the case of many species. Mr. and
Mrs. Peckham observed several instances of this remarkable
sequel to Love’s embraces. In describing the
female of <i>Phidippus morsitans</i> they remark that she
was “a savage monster. The two males we provided
for her had offered her only the merest civilities, when
she leaped upon them and killed them.” The first pair
of legs in the males of this species possess “special
adornments” in the shape of long white hairs, and it was
“while one of the males was waving these handsome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>legs over his head that he was seized by his mate and
devoured.” Again, in the case of a male of <i>Phidippus
rufus</i>, the display of his “ornaments” was his undoing,
for he was “caught and eaten when he insisted upon
showing off his fine points too persistently.” Thus the
females seem to “select” the more resplendent males
as much for eating as for mating! The ogre-like habits
of the females in this regard, indeed, are almost without
parallel in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>Anyone who cares to take the trouble to watch the
web of the large Garden Spider (<i>Epeira diademata</i>) may
witness one of these connubial tragedies. In this species,
the males are conspicuously smaller than the females,
and it is possible that this disparity has been brought
about by Sexual Selection, the largest and least active
males having been exterminated. In some species the
discrepancy in size is most striking, as for example in
<i>Nephila chrysogaster</i>, the female of which measures two
inches in length, the male not more than one-tenth of
an inch, and less than one one-thousand-three-hundredth
part of her weight.</p>

<p>The males, apparently, fully realize the perils which
their amours may lead them into. They haunt the borders
of the webs of unmated females, but exhibit a hesitating,
irresolute manner. For hours they will linger near her,
feeling the silken carpet cautiously with their legs, and
apparently trying to ascertain the nature of the welcome
likely to be extended to them. The odds are against
them: for even if allowed to mate, unless they are
extraordinarily agile in slipping away the moment they
have attained their object, the chances are they will
be slain and eaten!</p>

<p>Among some species, however, matters are otherwise:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>for the males of the genus <i>Linyphia</i>, for example, are
generally to be found living peacefully with their
consorts.</p>

<p>More rarely the male weaves a small nuptial tent, into
which he partly leads and partly drives the female:
though the “driving” would appear to be merely for
form’s sake! The habits of the Cellar Spider (<i>Tegenaria
parietina</i>), a long-legged species fairly common in the
South of England, affords a yet further interesting and
instructive contrast with the foregoing accounts. The
pairing habits of this species have been studied by many
observers, but perhaps the best account is that of Mr.
F. M. Campbell. He found, to begin with, that in this
species the tender ties of mating are at any rate rarely
violated by the horrible aftermath of cannibalism so
common a feature with so many other Spiders.</p>

<p>One or two illustrations from Mr. Campbell’s work
must suffice. On one occasion he placed together a
male and a female. For four days they took no notice of
one another; then the female cast what proved to be
her last skin, and within three hours after, the male began
to show signs of interest in her presence—which is a fact
of some significance, for not till then had she attained
maturity. “After a few convulsive twitchings of the
legs, the male pressed forwards, moving his palpi”—the leg like
“feelers” on each side of the head which form the
genital organs (page 241)—“up and down, when, as they
touched the palpi of the female, the pair played with
these organs like two friendly bees with their antennæ.
After a few minutes the female raised herself, leaning
a little on her left side, and the male crept forward until
his head was under the breast of his mate, while his
first pair of legs were resting upon hers. He now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>advanced his right palpus, leaning a little to the left and
using the left palpus as part of his support. The right
palpus was slightly twisted so as to bring the surface
(containing the fertilizing germs) opposite the sexual
organs of the female.... He now rapidly raised his
palpus up and down for four or more seconds, and with
such energy as to compel her to assume a vertical position.
He then retired and again approached her, repeating
the movements ... occasionally pausing before he
withdrew his palpus.... At times he would leave the
female for five minutes, and strut with straightened legs
round the vase, wagging his abdomen. Now and then
he would remain perfectly still with the palpus withdrawn,
or play with the palpi of the female, while she
seemed in a comatose state. He would then renew the
union with undiminished vigour, appearing on each
occasion less desirous of changing his position. I left
them at 12–30 a.m. and returned at 7 a.m. The male
was still using his right palpus. I saw no application
of the left palpus, but have no doubt that it was employed
during the night, as in other cases. I have not
observed the pairing ever interrupted by a fresh collection
of semen, although there is no reason to think this may
not occur. The duration of pairing is long; but I am
inclined to think it is more dependent on the difficulty
in inserting the palpus than on sexual endurance. The
impregnation appeared to take place when the male
retained his palpi in front of the bursa copulatrices for
about thirty seconds, which was frequently the case.”
There are occasions, however, when a very different
sequel attends this dalliance. In one instance, for
example, Mr. Campbell placed a pair together, and at
once the male began to pay his addresses. “Shortly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>afterwards he rapidly applied one of his palpi to the
female ... apparently with her consent.” Five hours
later “he charged her, tore away two legs ... and
began to suck one, using the mandibles to hold the limb
as a human being would a stick of asparagus.” It is
not surprising to find she died an hour afterwards. An
examination of her remains brought to light the fact
that she was not mature. But this does not apparently
explain the ferocity of her partner, for this investigator
on two other occasions saw males similarly dismember
their spouses an hour or so after impregnation. This
horrid feast cannot have been prompted by hunger, for
one of these males had, but a few hours previously,
eaten a daddy-long-legs and two blow-flies. Only twice
did this investigator see a female of this species drive
away a male, and in each case immediately after union.
“On the other hand,” he says, “I have kept an adult
pair together from the 22nd of August to the 28th of
October, and they lived in perfect amity. The male
never ceased paying unrequited attentions except to feed.”
It will have been remarked that the behaviour of this
species in regard to mating differs conspicuously from
the accounts of observations on other species, wherein
the aggressive instincts are displayed by the female.
Mr. Campbell, commenting on these facts, remarks that
such conduct is just what one would expect from creatures
which lead solitary lives, and must have “come to regard
weaker forms of animal life as food, or as an inconvenience,
if we except its young or its mate when in the act of
pairing.” Instincts which are habitually practised
throughout the greater portion of the life of the species,
and on which existence depends, would scarcely be
suspended for a longer period than necessary for sexual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>union. Spiders frequently eat one another, and such
an occurrence after pairing is only curious if considered
apart from their habits. When the sexual desire is
satisfied, their actions would again be directed by the
dominant instinct of destruction.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that the attack, when made by a
female, often immediately follows the sexual union, while
in the case where males assume the aggressive it takes
place some time afterwards. Mr. Campbell explains this
by the supposition that the action of the female, when
satiated, would be precipitated by the threatened and
unacceptable continued application of the hard, spiny
palpus, while the more lasting desire of the male would
have to subside before he became directed by another
instinct. By that time, other attractions, if not his
wandering disposition, would take him away from the
web.</p>

<p>The fact that male Spiders are comparatively rare
is perhaps explained by the fact that they are very short-lived;
they probably die soon after pairing—even if they
are not eaten! The snares they spin, it is to be noted,
are very imperfect, though curiously enough, when young
they make perfect snares on a small scale.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed, in the course of the foregoing
descriptions, that Spiders display a more or less conspicuous
wariness, a cool, deliberate “counting on the
cost” in their matrimonial ventures that is often wanting
in such matters in the human race. But, then, the
risks involved are more patent, more imminent. Mr.
Campbell comments on this intelligent behaviour in the
case of the Cellar Spider, remarking that they measure
“each other’s strength when on the same web by the
tension and motion of the threads.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>A word as to the Scorpions. These creatures are near
relations of the Spiders, and in many things resemble
them, notably in regard to their ferocity. One does not
meet here, however, with the same disparity in size
between the sexes, nor are vivid colours ever developed.
This, according to some, would be accounted for by the
fact that though these creatures possess numerous eyes
they are practically blind, and depend for their information
as to what is going on around them by their sense of
touch, which is excessively delicate. They are morose
in disposition and always solitary. It has been said
that if two are found under the same stone—a favourite
lurking-place—one is engaged in eating the other!
Nevertheless, they are of abstemious habits, for the
naturalist Fabre found that from October to March they
last, though throughout this time they remain alert,
and always ready to resent disturbance. In April they
exhibit more activity, though even then they eat but
little. But now they begin to wander in search of
mates.</p>

<p>Fabre’s observations on their mating habits are exceedingly
interesting, and they have brought to light some
very extraordinary phenomena. His notes were made
on the species common in the South of France—<i>Buthus
occitans</i>. Mr. Cecil Warburton, referring to the distinguished
Frenchman’s work, quotes the following noteworthy
passage in the Cambridge Natural History:
“After some very curious antics, in which the animals
stood face to face with raised tails, which they intertwined ... they
always indulged in what Fabre calls
a ‘promenade à deux’ hand in hand, so to speak, the
male seizing the chelæ of the female with his own and
walking backwards, while the female followed, usually
without any reluctance. This promenade occupied an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>hour or more, during which the animals turned several
times. At length, if in the neighbourhood of a suitable
stone, the male would dig a hole, without for a moment
entirely quitting his hold of the female, and presently both
would disappear into the newly-formed retreat.”</p>

<p class="center">SCORPIONS.</p>

<p>The early stages in the courtship of the scorpions are full of romance. The two prospective partners for life engaging in a kind of
waltz, holding each other’s “hands.”</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 252.</p></div>

<p>After the mating, as with the Spiders, the male is often
devoured by the female. After any combat with an
enemy, such as a <i>Lycosa</i> or a <i>Scolopendra</i>, it seems to be
<i>de rigueur</i> to eat the vanquished.</p>

<p>If the mating period in the case of the higher animals
rouses the males to the pitch of frenzy, that frenzy is
dangerous only to possible rivals. With the more lowly
Spiders and Scorpions ferocity of disposition is a normal
feature, and one which can with difficulty be held in
check long enough to permit the all-important act of
mating to take place. In how far this is accounted for
by the extremely deficient senses of sight and hearing,
which are such marked features in these animals, it would
be difficult to estimate. But that the manner of their
display is governed by these deficiencies there can be no
doubt. The Spider, having a more or less efficient vision
at short range, executes more or less elaborate antics
in front of the female, designed, as in the case of the
birds, to serve as excitants to fan sexual desire, already
smouldering, to a flame. With the purblind Scorpion
the Spider-antics are useless; he must proclaim his
desire by a pressure of the hand, and by intertwining
his tail with that of his prospective mate as they “walk
out” together. But Scorpions at one time were credited
with a very acute sense of hearing; later investigations,
however, fail to yield any evidence whatever that they
possess this sense, though experiment has proved that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>their sense of touch is excessively delicate and seems to
reside in the hairs which are thickly distributed over the
legs and body. Now, hearing and touch are senses near
akin, and the vibrations produced by stridulation may be,
and probably are, received by, and interpreted through,
the medium of these hairs. For though the Scorpion may
not respond to sounds made by curious investigators, it
may be that they can perceive notes of a low pitch
imperceptible to our ears, such as are made by stridulating
organs, as in the case of the Spiders.</p>

<p>Perchance certain comb-like structures known as the
“pectines” may play a part in mate-hunting. These
are placed on either side of the under-surface of the body
between the last two pairs of legs. The fact that they are
larger in the male, and sometimes strangely modified in
the female, seems to show that they have some function
in relation to sex. They also appear to serve as sources
of information as to the nature of the ground traversed
by the animal, since they are long in species which walk
with the body raised high off the ground and short in
such as adopt a more grovelling posture. That the
Scorpions possess but a very limited means of gleaning
information of the outer world there can be no doubt.
How, then, do they find one another when that insistent
desire to mate begins to make itself felt? Are the
“pectines” their informants through the sense of smell?
Do the hairs scattered over the body act as sound-collectors
responding to the notes emitted by the stridulating
organs? These are points on which information is much
to be desired.</p>

<p class="center">THE FEMALE MANTIS DEVOURING HER MATE.</p>

<p>With these insects, as with the spiders and scorpions, the male is often eaten by the female.</p></div>

<p>Our survey of the “Arthropoda,” as those limb-bearing
jointed animals invested in a horny, or, more exactly,
a “chitinous” external skeleton are called has so far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>been confined to such as, during adult life, at least, are
land-dwellers. But the aquatic types known as the
“Crustacea” furnish some extremely interesting facts
in regard to the problems of sex. In the first place, they
too possess a stridulating apparatus. This is curious,
but not surprising, because, although the skeleton of
such creatures is of a harder and almost stone-like
character, the development of roughened surfaces working
in opposition to one another might well have been
foretold to occur, at least in some individuals. Colonel
Alcock—a naturalist who has contributed largely to our
knowledge of marine animals by his researches in the
Indian Ocean—in his most delightful book “A Naturalist
in Indian Seas,” describes what he calls a “musical
crab.” This is the great-horned Coromandel Strand Crab
(<i>Ocypoda macrocera</i>). In both sexes of this remarkable
genus he says, “the nippers, or chelipeds, are singularly
unequal in size, and in all the species but one there is
present on the inner surface of the ‘hand’ of the larger
cheliped a transverse row of five teeth, which, when
the cheliped is flexed, can be made to play against a
ridge or another row of teeth on its ‘arm’ ... much
as a man might rub one side of his chest with the palm
of the corresponding hand. The whole mechanism,
except that it is on a larger scale and has a more finished
appearance, is very much like that by means of which
crickets and grasshoppers produce their shrill music,
and no one has ever doubted that it is used for the same
purpose, though very few people have actually heard
it in action. I myself ... was beginning to think that
the structure must, after all, have some quite other
function, when one morning ... on the sandy wastes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>of the Godavari delta, I at last, like Ancient Pistol, heard
with ears that which I had been so long waiting for. That
is to say, I heard a noise very much like that which an
angry squirrel makes, and discovered that it came from a
red ocypode crab into whose burrow another individual
had trespassed.</p>

<p>“In order to understand the matter it should be known
that these crabs ... are gregarious, and that each one
has a burrow of its own. Though they may be seen
marching in battalions across the sand, yet as a rule they
stay close to their burrows, methodically searching and
sifting the surrounding sand for any food that may have
been thrown up by the tide, and flying to their burrows
with headlong speed when alarmed. At first sight one
does not understand the necessity for so much wariness,
and for such a deep system of entrenchment, for the
creatures seem to hold undisputed possession of the whole
shore; but as a matter of fact they are preyed upon all
day long by Brahminy kites, and when the jackals come
out in the evening, by them. Now, although each crab
may on ordinary peaceful occasions know its own home,
yet when a crowd of them are running for their lives they
may sometimes, one would think, act on the devil take the
hindmost principle and try to squeeze into the nearest
burrow. But as ancient philosophers do report, things
may be done upon occasion which it is inexpedient to
make a habit of doing, and this seems to be one of those
things; for if many Crabs made a practice of crowding
into one small burrow they would certainly run the risk
of being suffocated, if not crushed to death outright. It
seems probable, therefore, that it would be advantageous
to the species as a whole if the rights of property in
burrows were rigidly respected, and if each individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>member possessed some means of giving notice that its
burrow was occupied ... and I think that this consideration
gives us a clue to the use of the stridulating
mechanism. At any rate, I was often able, after my
first accidental discovery, to elicit the sound, by catching
one of these crabs and forcing it into a burrow which
I knew was already occupied: the intruder would never
go far in, but would crouch just inside the mouth of the
burrow, and if it were made to travel deeper, then the
voice of the rightful owner would be heard in indignant
remonstrance from the depths.” Another species, the
Grey Ocypode Crab (<i>Ocypoda ceratophthalmus</i>), possesses
a similar instrument, and makes therewith a loud, croaking
noise. But it does not often burrow deeply. Colonel
Alcock therefore suggests that in this case it may be used
for scaring enemies.</p>

<p>That these curious musical instruments may also be
used in mate-hunting seems highly probable. If the
stridulation is produced on one occasion to announce
the fact that callers are not desired, it may on another
signify an equally emphatic invitation to enter, the mood
of the occupant being expressed by the character of the
sounds emitted. It is significant, at any rate, that there
are no external sexual differences in these species; hence
the probability that it is by stridulation that the sexes
distinguish one another.</p>

<p>This view seems to obtain confirmation from the fact
that the Crabs of the genus <i>Gelasimus</i>, or “Fiddler-crabs,”
which are near relations of the ocypode Crabs, and, like
them, live in burrows in large companies, and are exposed
to the same enemies, which they avoid in the same way
by burrowing, have no stridulating mechanism, but
the sexes are strikingly different. This is especially so
in the case of the nippers, or chelipeds. These, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>female, are slender and much shorter than the legs, being
used mainly for feeding. In the adult male one of these
“hands” is often twice as big as the body itself! “Many
uses,” remarks Colonel Alcock, “have been assigned to
this enormous, lop-sided organ: some say that it is used
as a stopper to barricade the mouth of the burrow, others
that it is a sort of cradle or bridal-couch upon which
the female reclines—the male, in this case, literally
bestowing his hand upon the female; but from observations
of <i>Gelasimus annulipes</i>, the species which most
frequents the Godavari mud-flats, I believe that it
primarily serves as a war-club, for the males indulge in
interminable tournaments for the hand of the female;
and secondarily, for it is of a most beautiful cherry-red
colour, as an ornament to attract and delight the latter
capricious sex.</p>

<p>“Landing one afternoon in March upon a cheerful
mud-flat of the Godavari sea-face, I was bewildered by
the sight of a multitude of small pink objects twinkling
in the sun, and always, like will-o’-the-wisps, disappearing
as I came near to them, but flashing brightly on ahead
as far as the eye could reach. It was not until I stayed
perfectly quiet that I discovered that these twinkling
gems were the brandished nippers of a host of the males
of <i>Gelasimus annulipes</i>. By long watching, I found
out that the little creatures were waving their nippers
with a purpose—the purpose apparently being to attract
the attention of an occasional infrequent female, who,
uncertain, coy, and hard to please, might be seen unconcernedly
sifting the sand at the mouth of her burrow.
If this demure little flirt happened to creep near the
burrow of one of the males, then that favoured individual
became frantic with excitement, dancing round his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>domain on tip-toe and waving his great cherry hand as
if demented. Then, if another male, burning with
jealousy, showed a desire to interfere, the two puny little
suitors would make savage back-handed swipes at one
another, wielding their cumbrous hands as if they had
no weight at all. Unfortunately, though I spent many
a precious hour on the watch from time to time, I could
never see that these combats came to anything; the
males seemed always to be in a state of passionate excitement,
and the females to be always indifferent and
unconcerned; and though the dismembered chelipeds
of vanquished males could often be seen lying on the
battle-field, I never had the satisfaction of beholding a
good stand-up fight, fought out to the sweet end, or a
female rewarding a successful champion with her
heartless person.”</p>

<p>The fascinating tale of Colonel Alcock’s observations
does not end here, however, for he has brought to light
some extremely interesting facts in regard to the sexual
aspect of Crustacean life in the deep sea; information
gathered during his exploration work on board the
Investigatory much of which was done to enlarge our
knowledge of the abysses of the ocean where the light of
day never penetrates. Here, he remarks, the conditions
of life might seem to be reduced to a minimum
of simplicity, yet evidences are not wanting that, among
the higher Crustacea, they are complicated, much as
they are everywhere else, by the play of the sexual
instincts.</p>

<p>In these awful depths, where reigns eternal night,
most of the inhabitants, of whatever kind, from fishes
downwards, are blind and eyeless, or they possess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>enormous eyes and a purblind vision responding to the
only light these regions display, that of phosphorescence,
which is generated by so large a number of those creatures
which are condemned by Fate to live this sunless life.</p>

<p>“It is written,” he remarks, “that the male must
exert himself to find a mate, and where sight cannot
help him in his search, a kind of blind-man’s buff is the
only alternative. In this serious game many deep-sea
Crustacea, especially those of the Shrimp-tribes, trust
to the sense of smell, as the greatly developed outer, or
olfactory, branch of the first pair of antennæ bears
witness. These antennæ, again, seem to be used by
the males of some species for catching their partners, and
in <i>Parapeneus rectacutus</i> ... they are turned into a
sort of crook for this purpose. This has long been thought
to be their function in the Prawns of the oceanic genus
<i>Sergestes</i>.” In the male of certain other deep-sea Prawns,
the hind pair of foot-jaws are modified in a way which
can only mean that they are used for hooking on to a
partner of the opposite sex. In the deep-sea Hermit-lobsters
of the genus <i>Munida</i> the nippers are greatly
enlarged, as in many Shore-crabs, for the purpose of
subjugating rivals and embracing the females; and in
all such cases these are much smaller in the female and
immature male.</p>

<p>Mention of numerous cases has already been made
where the female is larger than the male, and is the more
pugnacious, and in such cases the females are generally
more numerous than the males. Some of the deep-sea
Prawns exhibit the same peculiarity. And in these the
sword-like forward prolongation of the head-shield is
far larger than in the male. Now this rostrum is the
most formidable weapon which the Prawn possesses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>so that we may, with tolerable certainty, conclude that
the females fight their rivals for the possession of the
males, which are, in these species, far less numerous than
the females.</p>

<p>Among the lower Crustacea, such as the “Fairy-shrimps,”
“Brine-shrimps,” the “Water-fleas,” and the
“Copepoda,” which play so important a part in furnishing
food for many of the fishes which in turn feed us, secondary
sexual characters of an extremely interesting kind are
met with. These, however, are never such as appeal to
the eye, for the vision in these creatures is but feebly
developed. Scent, as is usual where sight is defective,
plays an important part in enabling the sexes to discover
one another. Selection here secures success only to
such as have the proper odour and the most sensitive
organs of smell. In these creatures, as with the butterflies
and moths, the odour emanating from the female
is most powerful, while the sense of smell is most developed
in the male. One of the most striking illustrations of
these facts is furnished by that very beautiful species
<i>Leptodora hyalina</i>—a veritable giant among these small
Crustacea—wherein the antennæ of the male are produced
into enormously elongated comb-like structures, the
teeth of the comb being formed by delicate olfactory
filaments. In the female these antennæ are extremely
short and their olfactory filaments are limited to a small
terminal tuft to the antennæ, answering to the larger
tuft at the base of the comb of the male.</p>

<p>To the majority of species, however, delicate odours
seem to make little or no appeal, since excessive development
of the olfactory apparatus, such as is seen in the
aberrant Water-flea (<i>Leptodora</i>), is rare. This is perhaps
explained by the fact that Leptodora is a species which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>does not herd together in vast numbers, hence, probably,
the need of some exceptional means whereby the males
may discover the whereabouts of the females, while in
the case of the swarming hosts formed by Water-fleas
and Brine-shrimps, for example, no such highly specialized
aid is necessary. Instead, the males have developed
powerful arms for the capture and retention of the females.
In the case of the Brine-shrimp these arms are of quite
formidable proportions. The males of the Copepoda,
remarks Weismann, “possess on their anterior antennæ
an arrangement which enables them to throw a long,
whip-like structure like a lasso round the head of the
female as she rapidly swims away. The antennæ of
the male Daphnids, too, are in one genus (<i>Moina</i>)
developed into a grasping apparatus; ... the first
antennæ ... are not only much longer and stronger
than those of the female, but they are also armed with
claws at the end, so that the males can catch their mates
as with a fork, and hold them fast. And even that was
not enough, for, in addition, the males of most Daphnids
possess a sickle-shaped but blunt claw on the first pair
of legs, which enables them to cling to the smooth shell
of the female, and to clamber up on to it to get into the
proper position for copulation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><p class="right">Plate 40.</p>
<img src="images/i_fp262.jpg" width="500" height="292" alt="" />

<p class="center">SOME REMARKABLE DEVICES.</p>

<p>1. A Water-flea (<i>Moina rectirostris</i>): male showing the claspers-the front pair of “legs,” for grasping the female.</p>

<p>2. The female of the same, in which the “claspers” appear as mere stumps.</p>

<p>3. The aberrant Water-flea (<i>Leptodora kindlii</i>): the male showing the long comb-like antenna for the discovery
of the female (the left only is drawn), and the female, just beneath, lacking this olfactory organ.</p>

<p>4. An extraordinary species of Bug in which the upper surface of the thorax has been produced backwards to
form an overhanging pent-house, of unknown function, and illustrating the theory of “Hypertely.”</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 262.</p></div>

<p>“If we inquire into the manner of the origin of secondary
sexual characters of this kind, we shall find that both
may have been increased by sexual selection, for a male
with a better sickle will succeed more quickly in getting
into the proper position for copulation than one with a
less perfect mechanism. This assumption does not rest
on mere theory, for I was once able ... to observe for
a considerable time, under the microscope, a female to
whose shell two males were clinging, each trying to push
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>the other off. Nevertheless, it seems to me very questionable
whether the origin of this sickle-claw can be referred
to sexual selection, for without this clamping-organ
copulation in most Daphnids would not be possible. It
was thus not as an advantage which one male had over
another that the clamping-sickle evolved, but rather as
a necessary acquisition of the whole family, which must
have developed in all the species at the same time as
the other peculiarities, and notably those of the shell.
The competition of the males among themselves is thus
in this case simply an expression of the struggle for
existence on the part of the species as such, and it is not
a question merely of a character which makes it easier
for the males to gain possession of the females, but of
one which had necessarily to arise lest the species should
become extinct. In other words, in this case Natural
Selection and Sexual Selection coincide.</p>

<p>“The case of the antennæ of <i>Moina</i>, which have been
modified into grasping organs is quite different; these
owe their origin, not to natural selection, but to sexual
selection, for antennæ of that kind are not indispensable
to the existence of the species, as we can see from the
closely related genera, Daphnia and Simocephalus, where
the males have quite short, stump-like antennæ, furnished
with olfactory filaments not much more numerous than
the females possess. Just as these supernumerary
olfactory filaments were produced by sexual selection
and not by the ordinary natural selection, because those
males with the more acute sense of smell had an advantage
over those in which it was blunted, so the males of the
genus Moina which could grasp most securely had an
advantage over those that gripped less firmly, and thus
arose these two different kinds of male characteristics.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>Neither of them is of advantage to the species as such,
but only to the males in their competition for the possession
of the females.”</p>

<p>Much uncertainty would seem to exist in regard to
two very extraordinary marine species of Copepoda. In
one, <i>Calocalanus pavo</i> the male possesses enormous
antennæ, and a remarkable development of iridescent
feather-like structures at the end of the body, arranged
in a sort of open fan-work; the female has what may be
called “normal” antennæ, and a brush-like tuft at the
end of the body. In the other species—<i>Calocalanus
plumulosus</i>—of which the female only is known, there is
a similar arrangement of plume-like structures at the
end of the body, but all but one are extremely small;
the single plume differs from the rest in being of enormous
length. Commonly these structures are regarded as
mechanisms to reduce the expenditure of energy
necessary to keep at the surface of the water, for these
creatures inhabit the surface-waters of the open ocean.
Many larval Crustacea inhabiting similar areas are in like
manner kept afloat, or at any rate aided in keeping afloat,
by the excessive development of spines. But if this be
the purpose of these strange excrescences of <i>Calocalanus</i>
it seems curious that the female of C. pavo should not
be similarly provided. If they are to be regarded as
secondary sexual characters it is curious that the females
of <i>C. pavo</i> and <i>C. plumulosus</i> should be so utterly dissimilar.
The male of <i>C. plumulosus</i> is unknown. On
the whole, it seems more reasonable to regard these strange
structures as mechanical aids to swimming rather than
as secondary sexual characters.</p>

<p>That the psychical emotions sway the goad of sexual

and there can be as little uncertainty that this stimulating
and controlling factor gradually loses force as we descend
in the scale of animal life. Just where it ceases it is
impossible to say. A vague, nebulous intelligence doubtless
persists after these more subtle emotions have ceased,
and this, probably, in turn, gives place to purely instinctive
behaviour. These various phases of the sexual
problem grade one into the other. But they are all parts
of a continuous sequence, beginning, apparently, in
relatively simple responses to chemical interactions of the
kind known as chemotaxis and ending with the passion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>which, in the human race, may become a consuming fire,
purifying and ennobling, or exactly the reverse—according
to the nature of the inflammable material. That is
to say, in the phenomena of sex one sees emotions in the
making. The begetting of children becomes the underlying
goal of life, the hidden heart and soul of animated
nature.</p>

<p>This being so, one cannot but feel surprised at the
discovery that, in certain groups of the animal kingdom
one meets with a strange exception to this great rule.
And this is furnished by the phenomenon of parthenogenesis,
wherein sexual desire has been dethroned. Offspring
result from Virgin births: parental care is non-existent.
This anomalous condition must be regarded
as an offshoot of the normal course of events traced in
these pages, and not as a primitive condition. This
interpretation seems to be shown clearly enough in that
almost every case where parthenogenesis obtains, males,
sooner or later, make their appearance—periodically or
sporadically. Every stage between the normal, seasonal
appearance of males and their entire suppression can be
traced, and an analysis of these cases demonstrates
unequivocally the uplifting character of the bi-sexual
state, if only by the fact that the uni-sexual condition
makes no demands on the parent, and does nothing to
foster the growth of the higher emotions.</p>

<p>No attempt need now be made to discover the origin of
parthenogenesis. Let it be assumed, for the moment,
that it is a condition derived from hermaphroditism,
wherein each individual is monœcious or bi-sexual. In all
diœcious or uni-sexual animals, that is to say, where the
individuals composing the species are either male or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>female, each contains a leaven of the opposite sex, even
when adult. It is still a moot point whether, in the
earlier stages of development, chance decides whether
the sex shall be male or female, or, at any rate, whether
the growing body is potentially male or female, till the die
is cast by some as yet undiscovered factor; or whether
this is determined from the very beginning of germinal
life. In many of the lower animals, as among the Mollusca
and some of the insects, each individual is as much male
as female, and it is from a condition such as this that
parthenogenesis probably had its rise.</p>

<p>These two groups are selected here because they, more
than any others in like case, afford some extremely
interesting gradations in this strange phenomena of
what is to be regarded as the degeneration of sexual
individuality, for each contains some members wherein
the sexes are separate, and in these cases sexual desire
is present in varying degrees. In some it is associated
with very remarkable phenomena.</p>

<p>Among the Mollusca the Octopuses afford one of the
most striking illustrations of such phenomena. In these
creatures one of the sucker-bearing arms is more or less
completely transformed to subserve the ends of sexual
congress. Without entering into the technical details
of the changes, it will suffice to remark that it is modified
in such a way as to allow the transference of the spermatozoa
from the body cavity wherein they are formed,
to the arm near, or at, the tip of which they are stored
in a special sac or “spermatophore,” and such modified
arms are said to be “hectocotylized.” This extraordinary
modification attains its maximum development in the
celebrated Argonaut, and one or two of the more typical
Octopuses. In the Argonaut this arm does not make its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>appearance until sexual maturity has been attained, when
a large more or less globular swelling appears, enclosing
the third arm of the left side, coiled upon itself. Having
attained its full development the sac bursts and releases
the arm. The folds which formed the sac now bend
back to form a new receptacle into which the spermatophore
is passed. But this is not all. The tip of the
newly released arm bears another sac, which sooner or
later bursts, forming a long, slender penis, and along the
central tube of this the spermatozoa pass from the
spermatophore to their destination. Their conveyance
thereto forms the last and most amazing feature of this
strange history. The male, eager with pent-up desire,
and glowing with all the colours of the rainbow, gradually
approaches the female of his choice, who apparently awaits
him with no little palpitation, and then, with a sudden
rush flings himself upon her, and apparently thrusts the
penis into her mantle cavity, when at once the whole
arm breaks off from his body and remains attached to
her person, retaining its vitality, strange as it may seem,
for some considerable time, during which, no doubt,
the spermatozoa are slowly making their way out of the
spermatophore and along the channel prepared for their
reception. That the Cuttle-fish are polyandrous there
seems to be little room for doubt, inasmuch as no less
than four such detached arms have been found beneath
the mantle of one female. With the majority of the
Cuttle-fish and Octopus tribe the arm is not detached,
but when it is so, and this occurs in all the species belonging
to three different genera, a new arm is grown.</p>

<p class="right">[Face page 268.</p></div>

<p>As a rule, among these animals the males are smaller
than the females. In the case of the Argonaut there is
a yet more striking difference, for the female possesses
a very beautiful shell in which she carries her eggs. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>remarkable cradle, translucent and beautifully sculptured,
she attaches to her person by means of a pair of arms which
are expanded to form great lobes, almost but not quite
completely covering the shell. The earlier naturalists
believed that this shell served as a boat, and that the
lobated arms were spread as sails! This supposed fact
naturally caught the fancy of the poets, who seized upon
it to point a moral and adorn a tale. Byron celebrated
these imaginary feats of seamanship in the familiar lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The tender Nautilus who steers his prow,</div>
<div class="line">The sea-born sailor of his shell-canoe.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and Pope bids us:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Learn of the little Nautilus to sail,</div>
<div class="line">Spread the thin oar, and catch the driving gale.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sir Richard Owen years ago, however, dispelled these
pretty fancies, though the facts are surely as wonderful
as the fables they have replaced. They afford, too,
one of the most striking secondary sexual characters to
be met with among the Mollusca; nowhere else, indeed,
among the members of this group is so strange a cradle
to be met with.</p>

<p>But little, unfortunately, is known of the behaviour of
these animals, which are by far the most active of the
Mollusca, and which also display no small degree of
intelligence. Their eyes, which are of great size and
complex structure, are undoubtedly far more effective
organs of vision than are possessed by any other Molluscs.
It is possible, therefore, that the sexes discover one another
by sight; and it is certain that something in the nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
of a “Courtship” takes place. The majority of the
species, also, possess the most extraordinary powers of
changing their coloration, especially during moments
of great excitement. The magnificence of the hues which
succeed one another, like a series of variegated blushes
suffusing the whole body, may be one of the weapons in
the armoury of Cuttle-fish love-making. In how far
the “courtship” of the Cuttle-fish resembles that of
terrestrial animals, however, is a matter on which at
present nothing is really known. That even the comparatively
sedentary species, like the Octopus, seize
upon and hold territory is very improbable, for there is
no need of such landed estates, inasmuch as the offspring
are not tended and fed by the parents—this would indeed
be a laborious task in the case of some of the “Squids”
which lay between thirty thousand and forty thousand
eggs! Having regard to the fact that the records of the
reproductive habits of the Octopus tribe date back to the
time of Aristotle, more than two thousand two hundred
years ago—for he first drew attention to the hectocotylized
arm—it is curious that so little has been gleaned during
this vast space of time.</p>

<p>There are facts in regard to the sexual relationships of
some of the Snails that are in nowise less remarkable
than those just related of the Octopus tribe. Unlike the
Octopuses, the Snails are hermaphrodite, nevertheless
sexual congress takes place as with unisexual species: the
eggs of the one being fertilized by the spermatozoa of the
other. During this process the orgasm of the sexual
act appears to be brought about by stabbing one another
by means of a little dart formed of carbonate of lime,
the dart burying itself in the flesh and apparently promoting
a pleasurable, tingling sensation in the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
of its journey. Speedily, no doubt, it becomes absorbed,
the material being then available for the formation of a
new dart.</p>

<p>This remarkable instrument, which is known as a
“Love-dart,” or <i>Spiculum amoris</i>, assumes a different
form in each species in which it occurs. In some the
shaft is ridged like a bayonet, as in the case of the Garden
Snail, in others the form assumed is that of an awl.
These darts are formed within a special receptacle, or
“dart-sac,” but so far no explanation as to the origin
of these remarkable structures has even been hinted at.
They do not seem to have been derived by the modification
of some pre-existing organ serving a different
function, as wings, for example, are derived from walking
limbs, or as lungs are derived from air-sacs. Their
origin is as mysterious as their use: for they are not
found in all Snails, though they occur in one or two Slugs—which
are degenerate Snails. But no other Molluscs
save the Snails and one or two of their immediate allies
are so armed.</p>

<p>The hermaphrodite conditions of these animals, as
with other Mollusca in like case, present some knotty
points for consideration, and especially in regard to the
problem of sex-attraction. Where each individual is
as much male as female, which is the dominating factor
in desire, the maleness or the femaleness? Though
each individual contains both ova and sperm cells,
probably these ripen at different times, to avoid danger
of self-fertilization. In this case the sex impulses are
on the same footing as in the case of animals wherein
the sexes are not thus combined. That is to say, the
individual which is for the moment only potentially male
mates with another for the moment only potentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
female. But this being so, how does each discover the
condition of the other?</p>

<p>Many of the Snails, like <i>Helix nemoralis</i>, are gaily
coloured. Are these hues, these bands of black and
yellow, the product of “sexual selection”—the outcome
of a process of selection from among the most conspicuously
coloured individuals as postulated by the Darwinian
theory of Sexual Selection? If so, then this
choice must be regarded as a periodic recurrence
coinciding with the period during which the individual
is dominated by its female attributes. In due course
it becomes, for the time, a male, and may find itself
rejected, owing to a lack of intensity in its coloration,
or, on the other hand, it may vanquish a rival by its
very splendour. Each, in short, would help materially in
this process of beautification. If the choice of mating for
it is this rather than a choice of mates—proceeds
on these lines, the bright coloration of the members of
this species becomes easy to understand. But does it?
It is more than doubtful whether the eyes of Snails are
sufficiently good to distinguish the coloration of their
neighbours’ shells, or for the matter of that of their
own, for their eyes being carried on long mobile stalks,
they should have no difficulty in contemplating their
own charms. And what of Snails of more sober hues?
It seems highly probable that here, as in so many cases,
scent is the selecting factor, and the coloration is an
“accidental” feature. That the colour of the shell
plays no such part as that just postulated may be
gathered from the evidence afforded by many marine
species, whose shells, though conspicuously marked, are,
during life, completely enveloped and concealed by the
all-investing, fleshy mantle. In like manner the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span> exquisite
beauty in the form and sculpturing of the shell
which so many species exhibit, are characters which
cannot be regarded as due to sexual selection.</p>

<p>As touching the danger of self-fertilization to which
reference has been made. That this is real is shown
by the fact that the ova and spermatozoa are rarely ripe
in one individual at the same time. However, among
the pulmonata, or air-breathing gastropods, it seems to
have been established that self-fertilization can, and
does, occur. That in some species, at any rate, where
cross-fertilization, for some reason, is impossible, the
individual thus isolated can store up its own spermatozoa
to be used in fertilizing its own eggs. But the fact
that this rarely happens is testimony enough that such
occurrences are inimical to well-being.</p>

<p>The Lamellibranch, or bivalve Mollusca, <i>e.g.</i>, Oyster,
Mussel, and Cockle, afford valuable evidence as to
excrescences and extravagances of growth which appeal
to our eyes as ornamental, and therefore likely to be due
to the influence of sexual selection. And this because
such ornamentation is a very conspicuous feature among
these animals. Yet, save in a few cases, locomotion is
impossible, and sight is wanting. Light-distinguishing
organs, and therefore eyes, are possessed by some, but
in no case probably are they strong enough to appreciate
form. Even if they did, such revelations of beauty would
play no part in mate selection from among the most
ornamental; for these creatures are commonly fixed
throughout life in one position, often, indeed, buried
in mud or sand. Some move laboriously: a few, like the
Cockles and Pectens, swim by rapidly opening and closing
the shell. The Pectens are brilliantly coloured, not only
as regards the shell, which is also beautifully sculptured,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>but the foot also is of a vivid scarlet, and the Pecten
have numerous minute eyes. But the Cockles and
Mussels possess like attributes as to colour and sculpture,
yet they are blind. More to the point is the fact that
these animals do not mate after the fashion of higher
animals, but the males, where the sexes are distinct,
discharge immense quantities of spermatozoa into the
water, and these find their way to the ova of the female
through the action of the inhalent currents set up by the
animal for the purpose of drawing in fresh supplies of
water containing food and oxygen. There are no
“secondary sexual characters,” that is to say, that even
where the sexes are separate, and many, like the Oysters,
are hermaphrodite, they are externally indistinguishable.
Nevertheless, many, as has been already remarked, have
shells of great beauty. As, for example, the giant Tridacna
and the strangely spinous valves of the “Thorny
Oysters” (<i>Spondylidæ</i>).</p>

<p>The fact that the Lamellibranch, or bivalve molluscs,
are far less numerous in point of species than the univalve
tribes is accounted for by the fact that in the first place
they are of necessity aquatic, and in the second their means
of locomotion is extremely limited. Some few species
swim spasmodically: some crawl: many are incapable of
movement when once the motile larva settles down and
the shell-bearing adult stage is attained. Such species
can extend their range only by means of larval wanderings.
Enormous numbers, millions, of young have to
be produced and set adrift each year by every adult
in the community, and yet but a few of each brood can
ever attain to maturity. Life, for such species, must be
a dull, monotonous business: the only opportunity for
excitement is that which is preliminary to being eaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>,
and the only purpose in life is to be eaten. But happily
Oysters don’t think. They and their kind are simply
semi-conscious living things, responding mechanically
to stimuli. Any approach, then, to beauty, either of
form or coloration, or both, must be regarded as due to
innate, inherent changes in the germ-plasm affecting
the parts so made conspicuous: the only form of selection
to which such “ornaments” can be subjected is
Natural Selection. If, and when, such ornaments
penalize their possessor either by their cumbrousness
or their conspicuous characters, or by increasing the
difficulty of feeding or distributing offspring, then the
further development of such excrescences is checked
by the death of all individuals which have passed the
bounds of endurance in this respect.</p>

<p>Sex, and all that appertains thereto, in short, is in
these creatures reduced to its lowest terms. There
are not wanting, to-day, both men and women, who
affect to believe that all would be well for the human
race could a similar slowing-down, or strangulation, of
the sexual instincts be brought about. Such blind
leaders might profitably contemplate the Oyster: but
such contemplation, to be profitable, requires intelligence
of a higher order than these protagonists of folly appear
to possess.</p>

<p>In justice to Darwin it should be remarked that he
himself fully realized, and carefully points out, the inconceivability
of the application of the Sexual Selection
theory to the Mollusca. In commenting on the beauty
of colour and shape which many species display, he
remarks: “The colours do not appear in most cases,
to be of any use as a protection; they are probably the
direct result, as in the lowest classes, of <i>the nature of the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span><i>tissues</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>: the patterns and the sculpture of the shell
depending on the manner of growth.” Just so: and
this is surely the fundamental explanation of ornament,
using this term in its widest sense, everywhere in the
Animal Kingdom. The peculiarities and eccentricities
of behaviour, which occur among the higher groups, act
as “aphrodisiacs” to hasten reproduction because this
confers an advantage, the earliest to produce offspring—so
soon as the conditions for their nurture are favourable—having
the best chance of survival. Premature sexual
activity is checked by the death of the offspring.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">1</span></a> Italics mine.</p></div>

<p>It has been contended that the hermaphrodite condition
represents the primitive mode of reproduction
among the multicellular animals—that is to say, all
animals above the level of those whose bodies are composed
of but a single cell, or particle, of protoplasm—but
this view is probably erroneous, and the hermaphrodite
state must be regarded as a secondary condition,
a later innovation.</p>

<p>More remarkable are the facts concerned with that
singular form of reproduction known as parthenogenesis,
or the production of offspring by virgin females. This
is undoubtedly a degenerate sexual condition occurring
as a normal mode of reproduction, among the microscopic
“Rotifers,” <i>e.g.</i> the “Wheel-animalcule,” Crustacea,
and Insects, and in varying degrees of intensity.</p>

<p>The most familiar instances of Parthenogenesis are
furnished by the Hymenoptera, and notably by the Bees
and the Aphides.</p>

<p>There are certain cases among the Rotifers where no
males have ever been found, and it is possible that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>have become entirely suppressed, but in every other case
the periodical advent of males is an absolute essential
for the continuation of the race. Perhaps the least
degenerate of these types are the Bees, wherein we meet
with well-developed, highly-organized males and females,
which, in their sexual relationships, are perfectly normal.
But in the fulfilment of the mating instincts in these
insects, a most amazing sequence of events is revealed
such as are without parallel in the rest of the Animal
Kingdom. The story has been charmingly told already
by Maeterlinck, in his delightful “Life of the Bee,” and
it has been told again by Tickner Edwardes, with less of
poetry, perhaps, but still fascinatingly: and it must be
told again now, but in a condensed fashion.</p>

<p>Briefly, a community of hive-bees harbours both male
and female individuals only for a very short space.
During the greater part of the year it consists only of a
vast concourse of infertile females, the daughters of one
mother; the “queen” of the hive. The males of that
hive are the brothers, not the fathers, of the workers, as
some have supposed, and their sojourn there is brief. To
gain a clear idea of the facts in regard to the life-history of
these insects it is necessary to trace some of the incidents
which lead up to the manner in which the population of
the hive is regulated, and its continuance ensured. These
may well begin with the time when the number of the
inhabitants consonant with the well-being of the hive
has reached its limit. This occurs during the early part
of June, when the queen leaves the hive, accompanied
by several thousands of her daughters; they settle at some
distance from their late abode in a “swarm” for the purpose
of founding a new colony. Here we may leave them.
The house just vacated is, however, not entirely deserted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
A few of the inhabitants, the infertile sexless workers,
degenerate females—degenerate so far as the power of
reproduction is concerned at any rate—are left behind,
and there remain also in their cradles a variable number
of unhatched queens, and drones or males. One of these
potential queens and the males now speedily emerge,
and for a day or two remain within the seclusion of the
hive, feeding upon the honey stored in the combs.</p>

<p>The males are the first to leave, making daily excursions
abroad in the search for mates. They display in
this a very leisurely behaviour, rising late and not venturing
out till the day is well aired. Returning early in the
afternoon with sharpened appetites, they feed to repletion
and soon fall asleep.</p>

<p>In about three days, however, the young queen ventures
abroad, timidly at first, to stretch her wings in the
sunshine. She is preparing for the great moment of
her life, the nuptial flight. So far, though drones may
swarm on every side of her, no sign of recognition
is given, nor do the males evince any consciousness
of her presence. She behaves warily and demurely
throughout. Her first excursions abroad are very brief;
they are not so much trial flights, apparently, as efforts
to locate the exact position of the hive in relation to
the outer world. To this end the flights are rapidly
extended in ever-widening circles, till at last, with lightning
speed, she makes for the blue sky, to return to the gloom
of the hive almost immediately after. During all this
time the stimulus of sexual desire has been gathering
force, and now, being no longer controllable, she darts
off, and up into the sky; almost at once she is recognized
by the swarms of males from neighbouring hives,
some thousands in number, which for days have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
seeking this event. Instantly they give eager chase,
mounting after her higher and ever higher. But as they
ascend so their numbers decrease. Some, the feeble,
the ill-fed from impoverished hives, are speedily left
behind; many endure to the end, but only one secures
the prize, and this great moment of his life is also his
last, for the fact of impregnation is no sooner completed
than Death claims him. He falls earthwards, as if struck
by lightning, and in his fall the intromittent organ is
dragged from his body, to be removed by the survivor
of this mad flight, on her descent.</p>

<p>She leaves a bride and returns a widow, filled with
murderous intentions. There are captive queens in the
hive, and she can tolerate no rivals. So soon as she has
removed from her person the embarrassing souvenir of
her nuptial flight she makes for the Royal cells.
Accompanied by attendant workers she proceeds to tear
off their waxen coverings and put their occupants to
death with a thrust of her stiletto. No sooner is the
work of execution over than the dead bodies are seized
by the workers and borne out of the hive. This awful
task is soon over, however, and henceforth for four or five
long years she remains a prisoner within the walls of
her own palace. Craving neither the air nor the light
of the sun, she will die without once having sipped the
nectar from a flower. And during all this time, save
during the winter sleep, her sole duty is to produce sons
and daughters. In the prime of her maternity she may
lay as many as three thousand eggs a day. But strangely
enough the number of eggs produced is determined for
her by the workers, who are the real rulers in this constitutional
state. By varying the amount and quality of
the food they give her they can increase or check the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
number of eggs produced; while even the sex of the
resultant larva is apparently also under their control.</p>

<p>During that brief, weird honeymoon in the clouds she
received a store of spermatozoa, the fertilizing male germs,
sufficient for all the eggs she can ever lay, and they may
amount to nigh on a million. Incredible as this may
seem, their purpose is yet more so; for they are destined
to be expended solely in the production of female offspring
doomed for the most part to perpetual spinsterhood. One
youngster in ten thousand may attain to a higher state,
may, if Fate wills, become a queen and mother. And
because of this need for mothers to carry on the race,
this extraordinary state of affairs has been brought about.
All is under the control of her daughters—the spinster-workers.
As she proceeds on her rounds of egg-laying an
attendant crowd waits upon her, controlling her actions
by gentle caresses. As she passes from cell to cell, the
cradles of the young that are to be, she thrusts down her
abdomen and lays an egg in each. The cells destined to
produce the workers are the smallest, those for drones
are larger, and those for queens are largest of all, and the
walls are formed of pure pollen, not of wax as are those
of the workers and drones. But it would seem that she
never lays an egg in any of the last named. The sight of
a queen-cell rouses her to fury. These cells, then, are
filled by the workers, who remove the requisite number
of worker—eggs from the cells in which they were laid and
deposit them in the queen-cradles. The larvæ at hatching,
and for the first three days of life, differ in no wise from
their sisters around them. Their Royal state is determined
solely by the food which is administered to them. This
consists of “bee-jelly,” which is furnished in abundance:
a white, shining liquid, regurgitated by the ever-zealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
nurse-bees. These superfed babies cease feeding at about
the fifth day, and each spins for herself a silken vestment
in which to undergo the pupal state. This done, the
door of each cell is sealed up with pollen. During the
following sixteen days strange transformations take
place: the queen that is to be is taking shape. But the
cradle now becomes a prison, for at the end of the sixteenth
day each of the four or five young queens begins to clamour
for release. But this cannot be, for such as succeeded in
emerging would immediately be slain by the reigning
queen. A small hole is bored through the roof of the cell,
and through this each is fed, and a close guard is kept
night and day to ensure that they shall not emerge till
the moment is ripe. Soon each captive begins to gnaw
away the roof of her prison chamber, and as rapidly
more material is placed by her guards on the outer surface.
Not until the old queen leaves the hive with thousands
of her daughters to “swarm” and found a new colony
will freedom be allowed; and then only to one. The
rest must remain till the new queen either also “swarms,”
or returns from her nuptial flight, and in this case all will
be slaughtered in their cramped quarters, unable to resist.</p>

<p>But what of the drone? He, as has already been
mentioned, is reared in a larger cradle than that of his
sisters—save such as are destined to be queens—and for
the first three days of his life is fed on “bee-milk” of a
special kind and more generous quality than that of his
worker—sisters, the Cinderellas of the hive; but this
generous diet is diminished at the end of three days,
when a mixture of honey and pollen is given him. In
about three weeks or rather more he emerges, a great,
lazy drone, and for a fortnight more he wanders about
the hive alternately soliciting bee-milk from his sisters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
and helping himself to honey from the comb, and when
full to repletion he seeks some snug corner in which to
sleep off his surfeit. In due time, however, he ventures
abroad, his hour is at hand. He takes his daily flights
abroad in search of a mate, returning home early in the
afternoon for his rations, being too indolent or too stupid
to draw nectar from the flowers for himself. Thus for
many days he and his brothers disport themselves in
riotous living, till one or other of them attains the end
for which he was born; and after a few delirious moments
drops earthwards a mutilated corpse.</p>

<p>But so far only a part of the story of the drone’s life-history
has been told. Though the son of a queen, he
has never had a father; and should he ever attain to the
dignity of fatherhood his posthumous children are
all daughters, most of whom die spinsters within six or
seven weeks of their birth, worn out by a life of ceaseless
toil and drudgery!</p>

<p>The queen, it will be remembered, cohabits with the
male but once in her life. The sperm-cells then received
are stored in a special receptacle and are released during
the passage of the egg down the oviduct. In this act
of releasing the fertilizing germs a singular economy is
practised. In the case of most other creatures myriads
of sperm-cells are released for the fertilization of a single
egg, and of these but one can possibly attain its goal,
the minute aperture or “micropyle” which is the doorway
to the germ liberated, in the form of an egg, by
the female. The rest die. In the case of the queen bee
but one of these precious sperm-cells is liberated at a
time. Hence her prolonged ability to produce fertilized
eggs. But eggs destined to produce males, or drones, are
never thus fertilized: they are born without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span> intervention
of a father. A queen which has never mated will
lay only male-producing eggs. This is an astounding
thing, but it is true. No less remarkable is the fact
that the sperm-cells should survive in their encapsuled
state for periods extending over several years: it seems
almost incredible, but it is nevertheless true.</p>

<p>One cannot suppose that the queen in coming to a
drone cell deliberately withholds the male germ as the
egg passes down her oviduct; some inhibitory factor preventing
the release of the sperm-cell must be brought
into play which as yet we have not discovered. This
production of males from unfertilized eggs, or “parthenogenesis”
as it is called, is a common feature among the
hymenoptera, and some other groups of insects, and it
occurs also among other lowly creatures to be described
later.</p>

<p>Having regard to the importance of the workers, a brief
summary of their life-history must be given. These, it
has already been indicated, are all, at any rate till three
days old, potential queens. Their development into, or
degradation to, the lower grade is determined, apparently,
solely by the quality of the food, for the fact that queens
are reared only in specially constructed cells of large
size with walls of pollen instead of wax is explained by
the larger size of the queen and the need for a more
porous, air-permeated cell-wall on account of the longer
time which must be spent in confinement. The worker is
certainly the most “intellectual” member of the hive,
but this superiority has been gained at a great price.
Emerging from the chrysalis skin at about three weeks
from the time that the egg from which she emerged was
laid, she begins forthwith to gnaw her way through the
mass of wax and pollen which forms the door of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
prison. Rather, she eats her way through, for the
material removed is swallowed as it is detached, thus the
young bee, as Mr. Tickner Edwardes remarks, is caused
to effect her own release by the promptings of her appetite.
Hunger-strikes in the bee community are unknown.
Speedily the youngster steps out, distinguishable from her
elder sisters only by her weak, grey-hued, flaccid appearance.
Her first act on gaining freedom is to groom herself
down, after which she proceeds to explore the gloomy,
busy, crowded thoroughfares of the hive. A day or two
is thus passed in gathering strength. On the second
appetite returns, and she proceeds to help herself from
the vats of honey and pollen bins scattered here and there
among the cradles of her sisters yet prisoners. But
speedily she is caught and thrust, so to speak, on to the
treadmill of work which is to know no cessation during
her short span of life-some six or seven weeks. Her first
duties are those of nursemaid. Without instruction, or
previous experience, she begins to feed her younger sisters
and brothers yet in the larval stage. But besides, during
her first fortnight, before she is allowed to leave the hive
she and her sisters of the same age have to fulfil a variety
of tasks. All the indoor work of the house falls on these
Cinderellas. Not only do they, and they alone, feed the
young, but they have to produce the wax and build the
combs and attend to the sanitary arrangements: “they
are the brewers of the honey and the keepers of the stores;
they feed the queen bee on her ceaseless rounds and give
the drones, their brothers, their daily rations of bee-milk”—what
else these lazy creatures need they take
for themselves from the honey-vats. But this is not all.
They have to meet their older sisters returning from the
fields and gardens laden with nectar. This is regurgitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
and transferred to the pouches of the youngsters, by whom
it is transformed into honey and stored in the combs in
the upper region of the hive. At the end of about a
fortnight these little drudges are allowed a brief respite,
during the heat of the day, to emerge into the outer air
and gather ideas on the world which is yet to be explored.
Soon a measure of freedom is allowed, the indoor work
ceases, and each takes up the new and more agreeable
task of gathering pollen, and after a few days of this the
more responsible task of gathering nectar is undertaken,
which is continued till death ends one of the most crowded,
surely, of existences. Such as are born near “swarming-time”
may have the good fortune to take part in the
exodus and the settling down in the new home, and some
may taste yet other moments of excitement, but they
are moments only. The worker bee knows no leisure for
the improvement of her mind and morals. She needs
none, for she has neither: she is a creature of routine,
a living automaton apparently. Yet there are incidents
in this wonderful community which seem too complex
to be merely the result of instinct unaided, uninspired,
by intelligence albeit of a nebulous kind.</p>

<p>The worker-bees, it has been remarked, are barren:
their reproductive organs are atrophied, and by the
decree, not of the queen-mother of the hive, nor of the
males, but of their own caste. In spite of the fact that
they are incapable of producing offspring, they, and
they alone, determine who shall undertake this task;
and they decree the fate that awaits those thus appointed
when they can no longer fulfil this purpose.</p>

<p>When the queen, waxing old, and waning in fecundity,
lays fewer and fewer eggs, and these only producing
males, they take silent note of the fact, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
appointed time decree the death of their Sovereign-mother.
Yet they hesitate to lay violent hands on her.
She, as queen, claimed the right in her early youth to
slay her sister-queens, and sped them with a dagger-thrust;
now her turn comes to die. But it must be a
bloodless death, carried out with due ceremonial. So
her daughters cluster about her, and in a mock embrace,
that tightens every moment, her breath is squeezed out
of her body. There are no State pensions for those who
are past work, but a State execution instead. This is
vastly more economical, and it may yet commend itself
to some would-be social “reformers,” who will doubtless
contrive to make exceptions to the rule!</p>

<p>The execution of a queen is not an event of common
occurrence; but that of male members of the hive forms
part of the ordinary routine, though coming only within
the larger cycle of the year. As the summer wanes and
the harvest of nectar grows perceptibly less, visions of a
possible famine, and its attendant horrors, seem to arise.
So heads are counted and occupations are scrutinized,
when it is discovered that the only members of the
community who are contributing nothing to the general
well-being are the males, who are now but useless drains
on the hive. None of the neighbouring hives are now
likely to send forth a virgin queen to her nuptials, to
which end each hive is obliged to contribute—for no hive
utilizes the services of its own drones; these idle fellows,
then, are “eating their heads off”—and males, too;
perish the thought! While they had anything to gain
from him their motto was “Feed the brute”; but now,
on each, doom is pronounced. It must be admitted
that a live drone at the end of summer is one of life’s
failures. Notoriously unable to feed himself save upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
the honey made by his sisters, and having no function
in life to perform save that of mating, his very existence
now is a damning witness against himself.</p>

<p>When the mother of the hive ceases to maintain the
standard of fertility set by her exacting daughters, she
is put to death stealthily, as if in an excess of devotion:
she is smothered under their embraces. Towards the
drones now under sentence no such consideration is
to be shown. When the word goes forth, the slaughter
begins, and it gathers in ferocity. It begins in a massacre
of the innocents—every helpless larval drone is ruthlessly
dragged from its cot and thrown out of the hive
to die: there is now no crime in infanticide, nor in the
most gruesome massacre that is presently to follow.
The drones, all unsuspecting, are to be tolerated a brief
spell longer. The cool, calculating spirit of these unsexed
ones seems to realize that there is even yet a remote
possibility that the services of these doomed ones may
be wanted. No sooner, however, does it become clear
that this chance is past, than the decree of death is made
absolute, and the poor drones are suddenly and viciously
attacked by half a dozen frenzied spinsters at once.
Each tries to bite through the base of the victim’s wings,
and succeeding in this, he is speedily pushed towards
the door of the hive and out into the open, whence
return is impossible, so that nothing is left but death
by starvation. Some of the victims will escape in the
<i>mêlée</i>, but only for a brief season. Such as find their
way, unmaimed, to the open air, are still faced by
inevitable death. To remain out is to die of starvation
or cold, to return is to fall a prey to the now infuriated
guards, who, strongly reinforced, stand at the doorway
of the hive to intercept and dispatch these unlucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
fugitives. It will be remarked that these executioners
make no use of their stings; these they might be unable
to withdraw from their victim’s body, in which case
they, too, would die. But there is no need to run this
risk, for the males, their brothers, whom they so cheerfully
slay, are unarmed; they may be attacked without risk.
The dreadful work, however, is soon over, and the survivors,
the queen and her daughters, have the house to
themselves to make the final preparations for the winter
sleep, which is apparently undisturbed by qualms of
conscience.</p>

<p>There are certain structural differences distinguishing
the three types in such a hive—the queen, the drone and
the worker—which must now be referred to. The queen
is larger than the worker; she has a larger and longer
abdomen, a longer and much-curved sting, and her eyes
have fewer facets. Only vestiges remain of the wax-secreting
organs, and no trace is to be found of the
wonderful pollen-baskets which perform so important
a function in the worker; and finally, her instincts are
of a very different kind.</p>

<p>The “pollen-basket” of the worker is a strange contrivance.
The pollen is mainly collected by the hairs
which clothe the under surface of the body, from which
it is scraped by special brushes of hairs which clothe the
inner surface of the “metatarsus “—the big, flat joint
to which are attached a series of small triangular joints,
the last of which bears the claws. When the brushes are
“clogged up,” the legs are crossed and the pollen is
combed out by specially stiff hairs on the “tibia”—the
joint immediately above the metatarsus—and the bolus
thus formed is then transferred to the outer surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
the tibia, which is trough-shaped, forming the “corbiculum,”
or pollen-basket. The next, or middle, pair of
legs are then employed to ram the pollen well into the
basket, for safe conveyance to the hive. On arrival at
the combs, the bee pushes its hind-legs into a cell, or
“pollen-tub,” and with a special spur dislodges the pellet
of pollen and lets it fall into the tub. These are complex
movements, performed without instruction and, we must
suppose, without any intelligent conception of their
purpose.</p>

<p>The drone is larger than either queen or worker, and
has enormous eyes, which meet one another over the top
of the head; he has no wax-secreting organs, no pollen-basket,
no sting. His antennæ are longer, his hum is
deeper, his sole function is to fertilize a queen, and this
done, he promptly dies. Failing in his first flight, he
may make yet other ventures, but the chances are that
he will die without attaining the only purpose for which
he exists.</p>

<p>The fact that he lives for some days in the hive with
the queen, before her nuptial flight, apparently unaware
of her presence, would seem to indicate some special
“trigger” for the release of the sexual instincts. But
it must be remembered that he does not attain to maturity
until after his first flight, and this it is, probably, which
arouses the mate-hunger. More than this, however, it
is probable that coitus is possible only when on the wing,
when the air-sacs become inflated, and exert pressure
on the genital organs. How he recognizes the queen
when on her wild flight heavenwards is unknown:
possibly by scent, but more probably by the very different
vibrative note of her wings, that of the male being much
stronger and deeper. His continued return to the hive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>is a proof of his failure to justify his existence, for no
drone ever experienced Love’s embrace and lived to
tell the tale: hence, when the time comes, he is slain
without compunction.</p>

<p>These differences between the fully-developed male
and female present nothing very striking; but how are
the singular peculiarities of structure and instinct in
the “workers” to be accounted for? They are present
in neither queen nor drone, yet by them they are transmitted
to their offspring from one generation to another!
It is true that every worker, for a time, is a potential
queen, and every queen, but for the grace of Chance,
might have been a worker. All depends on the food.
It is remarkable, but apparently the fact, that a more
generous diet, or, rather, a more stimulating diet, should
so profoundly modify the organism, but, it is to be noted,
this sleight-of-hand is only successfully practised on a
larva during its first three days of existence. Thus the
royal bee jelly stimulates the growth of the sexual
organs and inhibits the development of the structures
peculiar to the worker—the basket, and pollen-hairs,
and so on. These structures are not made by the
food; they are simply nourished or inhibited, as the
case may be. Nevertheless, one cannot help being
mystified by the fact that the mere difference in the
quality of the food, or, rather, in the chemical constituents
thereof, should cause the inhibition, or, rather,
the suppression, of relatively complex structures like the
corbiculum and the reduction of the number of the facets
of the eye. To say that the structures inhibited, in the
case of the queen, are just those which will be of no
service when in her royal state, is by no means to explain
the mystery. And what is true of the physical side is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
no less true of the psychical, for with this change of diet
the behaviour of the insect, throughout its whole life,
is most profoundly changed. If the pollen-basket is
wanting, no less so are the instinctive actions associated
with its use; if the genital organs are atrophied, so also
are the instinctive acts associated therewith. This nexus
between instinct and structure is not to be lost sight of.</p>

<p>How—and the question has often been asked—are the
experiences of the infertile females, the workers, transmitted
to the germ-plasm? For the workers, it has
been contended, being sterile, are incapable of handing
on such acquirements: this is so. These workers hold
the same position in regard to the species that structures
essential to well-being hold in regard to the individual.
These last are not under the control of the individual,
but are determined by a plus or minus quality in its germ-plasm.
The worker-bees are products of the germ-plasm,
committed to the care of the queens. Any strain, so
to speak, of that germ-plasm which gives rise to defective
workers brings about its own extinction, or elimination,
sooner or later. Any strain of germ-plasm which contains,
so to speak, a spark of that quality which in the
individual is expressed by intelligent behaviour, will
gain advantages in the struggle for existence.</p>

<p>The complex, the extraordinarily complex, behaviour of
the worker-bees on any interpretation is still mysterious.
This interpretation can be tested only by a reference to
the life-history of other social-bees which have attained
to a less complexity. This shows us that the sterile worker
is not to be regarded as a newly-evolved type so much as
an arrested stage of a more complete ancestral condition,
and the fact that the worker is potentially a queen is
further evidence of this.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>
<p>A clue to many of the more puzzling features presented
by the domestic economy of the Hive-bee may be obtained
by a study of the life-history of other species of social-bees
which have not attained to so high a degree of
specialization. The Bumble-bees afford illustrations of
the stages through which <i>Apis mellifica</i>, the Hive-bee,
must have passed.</p>

<p>In the stone Bumble-bee (<i>Bombus lapidarius</i>), a queen,
who has passed the winter in blissful sleep, will lay the
foundation for a new colony on some bright May morning
by collecting a small quantity of moss. This done, she
starts forth to gather pollen, with which, under cover of
the moss, she forms a waxen cell, mixing the newly-gathered
pollen with the wax so mysteriously formed
within her body, as in the case of Hive-bees of the
worker type. Slowly and laboriously this waxen cradle
grows. Fashioned like a globe, its inner surface is
lined with pollen soaked in honey, and with the last
pellet of this a number of eggs are laid arid the nursery
is sealed up. By the time these labours are completed
the queen is worn out; she therefore rests awhile, clinging
to the outer wall of this cunningly-wrought cradle. After
a few days’ rest she adds another and commonly yet a
third cell to the first, joining each to the other with wax.
But before the third cradle is finished the eggs in the first
have hatched. The youngsters will have consumed
the layer of honey-soaked pollen placed there for this
purpose. They therefore require feeding, and thus the
labours of this very industrious queen are still further
increased. Divining the needs of her imprisoned first-born,
she bites a small hole through the nursery wall and pours
in a quantity of honey for their sustenance. In due time
they are “full-fed,” and each spins for itself a silken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
vestment wherein to undergo its transformation into a
worker-bee. The careful mother, during this period
of transition, now scrapes away an opening through which
the young bees may creep when they awake. This event
takes place in the course of a few days, when her work
is materially lightened, for these newly-hatched workers
at once take over the duties of building nurseries and
feeding the further batches of young which, for a time,
follow one another in quick succession. The queen,
indeed, has now nothing else to do but to lay eggs in the
nurseries as they are ready. So far all the children born to
her are daughters. The earliest-born, it is to be noted,
were “workers”; those which follow and are tended
by the workers are also females, and supplement their
mother’s labours by producing fertile eggs, though they
have never even seen the male of their own species. Thus,
if the queen-mother die her virgin daughters carry on the
colony. But it sometimes happens that she may have
left no descendants capable, for the time, of laying fertile
eggs. In this case, if there be larvæ still in the nursery,
the workers feed them assiduously as if in the hope that
some may prove fertile. But if there be no infants to be
fed they apparently abandon work, become despondent,
and spend the greater part of their time sitting at home
by the empty cradles, till at last death comes to their
rescue and the colony is extinct.</p>

<p>Much that baffles one in the history of the Hive-bee
becomes clear in the light of the facts revealed by the
life-story of the Bumble-bee. In the first place it will
be remembered her first eggs produced only workers, which
appeared at a time when her energies were severely
strained, and their food allowance was no more than
barely sufficient to sustain life. The females which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
appeared later produced fertile eggs, having been more
abundantly fed by their infertile elder sisters. The
number of fertile females which appear at this stage of the
colony seems again to be regulated by the abundance
of food, which varies in amount with fine, or cold,
weather. Even among the worker broods fertile females
may appear. They owe their fertility apparently to good
luck, which afforded them the opportunity of securing
more food than their sisters. The birth of young from
females about whose virginity there can be no question
is certainly remarkable, but it would seem that this
parthenogenetic state is one of limited endurance, for
towards the end of summer males appear, and these
mating with some of the later-born females, lead again
to the appearance of a queen, who, being fertilized, alone
survives the winter to carry on the race with the
succeeding summer.</p>

<p>Thus, then, the mysterious existence of the workers
among the Hive-bees, displaying structural peculiarities
and instincts so different from those of the queen-mother,
is explained. For the queen, in this case, is evidently
the product of a more intensified, more perfected, social
system, relieved, from the first, of the labours of building
and the care of her offspring, duties which the queen
Bumble-bee has at first to perform for herself, because
all her children die at the end of the summer. Among
Hive-bees fertile workers also occasionally occur; they
are probably bees which in their larval state received
a more than usually abundant supply of food, or food
approximating to the “bee jelly” which produces young
queens. The difference, then, between the individuals
of a colony of Hive-bees and one of Bumble-bees lies
in the greater abundance of fertile workers and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
fact that the queen of the Hive-bees is relieved of all
work from the first, and so is enabled to devote her whole
energies to the duties of reproduction. She is the
descendant of a race of queens which in earlier times,
like the Bumble-bee queen, had to perform the duties
now relegated to her daughters, who inherit not only her
house-building and child-nurturing instincts, but also her
potentiality for child-bearing, though this potentiality
is commonly inhibited by the starvation of the reproductive
activities. Selection secures survival of this state
of affairs by the elimination of any tendency to lose any
of these qualities on the part of the queen. The workers
of the Hive-bee, in short, have not evolved their peculiarities
of structure and instinct by some mysterious
process of natural selection confined to the workers
individually, for these, being infertile, could not transmit
any of their inherent qualities or tendencies to variation
in the direction of more efficient workers. On the contrary,
all that they possess they inherit from the queen-mother,
who transmits to her offspring the qualities and
characteristics her forebears in the female line possessed in
their own person.</p>

<p class="indent f08">Courtship among the Ants—The Great Renunciation—Maternity
carried to Extremes—Where Males are Superfluous—Degenerate
Males—Keeping Death at Bay—Where Females are Unknown.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of virgin birth is one of profound
mystery. The existence of so astonishing a mode of
reproduction was an established belief among the
ancients, though they could have had no means of
demonstrating the faith that was in them. But these
men saw no difficulty in ascribing to the females of their
own race this faculty of producing offspring without the
intervention of a male. One suspects, indeed, that there
was no solid foundation whatever for this belief in these
miraculous powers: they lived in credulous times, and
the recorded occurrences of these, even to them, irregular
births are to be regarded as devised to afford a convenient
means of escape from the consequences of lapses
from the path of virtue. Yet, incredible as it may
appear, there are not wanting to-day both men and
women who affect to believe that this mode of reproduction
obtains still among the human race, in certain
exceptional cases; and further, they profess a conviction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>that in the future it may become the normal mode, males,
in consequence, becoming unnecessary! Such professions
of faith are made only by the ignorant, or by those who
trade on human credulity. Parthenogenesis not only
does not occur in the human race, but it does not even
occur in any member of the great group of vertebrates
of which man himself stands at the head, and it never
will occur.</p>

<p>Those near relations of the Bees, the Ants, afford a
further insight into this strange method of reproduction.
Each community in the case of these insects harbours
not one, but many queens. The nuptial flight, like that
of the Bees, takes place in mid-air; but myriads of both
sexes participate therein, forming a filmy, ever-shifting
cloud, now rising, now falling, in the shimmering sunlight.
At no time do they seek to attain the altitude, or the
privacy, so strenuously striven for by the Bees. But
in the case of the latter there is but one female, and her
life is precious. She must seek sanctuary for the consummation
of her marriage in the highest heavens,
beyond the risk of instant destruction by insect-eating
birds; for though thousands of suitors accompany her,
she rises above them all, save one or two, and hence
would form an easy mark. With the Ants there are
thousands of queens, and the destruction of a few hundreds
more or less is rather an advantage to the species
than otherwise. On their return to earth the males die:
their life’s work is accomplished. The females, or as we
must call them, the queens, on the other hand, have a
long life before them; far longer than that of the queen
bee. But for them the joys of flight are restricted to
this one brief revel, for, no sooner have they reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
terra firma, than they renounce, as it were, the pleasures
of life to devote themselves entirely to the work of reproduction.
And as if to make all regrets vain, to stamp
out all possible temptation to desert their vows, they tear
off their gauzy wings, and with them goes all hope of
fertile repentance: for the rest of this life their home
is underground.</p>

<p>Each queen, on her descent, departs a separate way,
and hard is the road before her. She left the parental
nest well-fed, and in good liking, her body well, stored
with food in the shape of fat and the now useless, bulky,
wing-muscles, and with this, her only dowry, she starts
the formation of a new colony out of her own substance.
Her first task is to form a burrow, and at the end of this
she fashions a small chamber. This done, she closes the
mouth of the burrow and cuts herself off from the world.
The labour of this burrowing is so severe that it often
wears away her teeth, her only tools, and the hairs from
her body. In this retreat she now waits patiently for
the eggs within her to ripen, which may take months to
accomplish: she is still fasting, or, rather, feeding upon
herself. When at last the eggs are laid and hatched, she
feeds her children on saliva, the very juice of her body,
for she is still fasting. Nor is the strain relaxed till the
larvæ undergo their transformation into pupæ, and, after
a brief sleep, emerge as “worker” Ants, puny in stature
owing to the poorness of their food during larval life.
In some species this fast may last for ten long months.
So soon, however, as these little workers emerge, like
dutiful daughters they make their way to the outer
world, and go forth in search of food, which they share
with their now exhausted mother. But, besides, they
enlarge the original chamber, and drive galleries in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
directions to provide accommodation for the vast population
that is soon to crowd the thoroughfares. Meanwhile
the queen resumes her task of producing more and
yet more daughters, in whom she now displays not the
slightest interest. Her elder children now bear away
the eggs, and feed the young as they hatch. In course
of time, as with the Bees, the task of wet-nurse falls on
the youngest of the Ants, those who have just attained
to anthood. For ten or fifteen years this queen-mother
may continue her work of reproduction, a slave, indeed,
to domesticity, with monotonous regularity, checked
only by the chill of autumn and the sleep of winter.</p>

<p>Those among our own race who profess to hail the
prospect of a time when parthenogenesis shall be the
normal mode of reproduction may well take the Ant
as an awful warning. Their ambitions may overreach
the mark. The poor queen becomes a slave to reproduction;
children in myriads are born to her; even if
she would she could not sustain her interest in them, she
could not even recognize them as the fruit of her body.
Her daughters are born to a lifelong drudgery, her sons
are mere fertilizing agents: for their only purpose in life
is to perpetuate this awful thraldom, this appalling
prolificness; and having accomplished this, they die
forthwith. If there be any joy in this life it is drunk
by the males alone. Thus does the female rule overreach
itself. It is well, indeed, that the participants of
the joyous nuptial flights dancing deliriously on gauzy
wings in the glare of a summer day, have no foreknowledge
of the long night that is to follow.</p>

<p>Unlike the Bees, the Ants may produce as many as
five grades of workers, each of which have different
duties towards the community. But the nature of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
duties and the manner of the evolution of these types,
are themes foreign to these pages: enough has been
said already to indicate the nature of the problems
they present when discussing the life-history of the
Bees.</p>

<p>The subject of parthenogenesis need be pursued no
further in this volume than is sufficient to bring out its
retrograde character. It is a form of reproduction which
may be limited to a small number of generations, as with
the Aphides, or to a single generation alternating with
normal sexual generations, as in many Cynipidæ or Gall-flies,
or it may be the only mode of reproduction, as in
some other Gall-flies, some Saw-flies and some Crustacea,
wherein no males have ever been seen. In some species
this form of reproduction gives rise to females only—the
Thelyotokous parthenogenesis of scientific text-books—as
in the Saw-flies and Gall-flies, and the parasitic
<i>Tomognatbous</i>. In some other Saw-flies, unfertilized
queens and workers of Ants, Bees, and Wasps, which
occasionally produce offspring, the progeny is always
male, and this is known as Arrhenotokous parthenogenesis.
In one or two species of Saw-fly, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Nematus
curtispina</i>, both males and females may be produced,
when the species is said to be Deuterotokous.</p>

<p>In the case of the Aphides, winged males normally
appear in large numbers at the end of the summer, and
these fertilize the females; but if kept in a warm green-house,
parthenogenetic reproduction may be sustained
for as long as four years. Under quite normal circumstances
these tiny insects show a singular range of
variability, for egg-laying and viviparous individuals are
met with; while winged and wingless generations appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
sporadically, apparently according to the abundance of
food. The winged form is sometimes so abundant as
to float about in swarms that darken the air. There are
at least three kinds of males-winged males, wingless
males with a functional mouth, and small wingless males
which have no mouth, and, one need hardly say, are
very short-lived. The Aphides are a feeble folk, individually,
but collectively a power in the land, causing at
times incalculable loss to the farmer and gardener; but
on this head and on the subject of their strange habits,
and sometimes adventurous lives as slaves in the service
of Ants, no more than a hint may be dropped in these
pages. But some such aids to faith seem to be necessary
when those who are not tolerably familiar with these
insects are told of their amazing fertility. Linnæus
long since estimated, in regard to one species, that in the
course of one year a single Aphis will give rise to a
quintillion of descendants—all produced without the
aid of a male. Every one of these females begins to
reproduce within from ten to twenty days of her birth,
but even this statement does not bring home the result
of such an astounding fecundity like Huxley’s calculation
which was carefully worked out. He estimated that
the produce of a single female would, in the course of
ten generations, supposing all the individuals to survive—and
possess the normal fertility of their race—“contain
more ponderable substance than five hundred millions of
stout men: that is, more than the whole population of
China.”</p>

<p>To explain such a riot of reproduction one might
almost suppose these insects to be imbued with a dread
of the impending dissolution of their race, and endowed
with the power to avert such a calamity by these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
stupendous efforts; for it is evident that parthenogenesis
confers quite extraordinary powers of raising the birth-rate.
But then the normal mode of procreation is capable of
achieving results quite as remarkable. The queen Termite
or White Ant, for instance—which, by the way, is no Ant,
but a near relation of the Stone-flies—when in her prime
will lay eggs at the rate of sixty a minute, or eighty
thousand and upwards in the course of a day of twenty-four
hours. But this unenviable mode of breaking the
record is attended, surely, with some little inconvenience;
for to attain to such fertility her abdomen increases until
it attains something like two thousand times that of the
workers of the community in which she lives. That
the history of the queen Termite is unique of its kind
is not surprising: indeed, such an amazing story could
only be told of creatures which enjoyed the seclusion of
a subterranean existence. Here, on a bare couch, with
her Royal spouse beside her, she lies, a bloated, heaving
mass, incapable of movement, depositing eggs with the
rhythm of a machine, the mother of offspring which she
will never see. A more unsightly picture of maternity
it would be impossible to conceive: it is well, indeed,
that it is hidden from the light of day. No such state of
affairs could ever arise among creatures living an outdoor
life, with enemies to avoid, and food to find.</p>

<p>The instances just surveyed, these extremes of the
potentiality of procreation, are instructive in more ways
than one. They are to be regarded as “excrescences”
of reproduction, comparable to those “excrescences”
of individual growth which we call “ornament,” for
example. Individuals on whom this fertility has settled,
so to speak, are the victims of the machinery of sex and
reproduction. Their amazing powers of multiplication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
are not of their own seeking, they are inherent manifestations
of variations of growth, uncontrollable save
by the machinery of Natural Selection. Incidentally
such victims serve a useful purpose, for their myriad hosts
afford food for hordes of other animals, which in turn are
eaten. Little though we realize it, the well-being of
the human race would suffer if these prolific creatures—the
uncomplaining victims of that inexorable law which
bids all living things “increase and multiply” or die—should
cease to be; for with them would disappear a
host of animals on whose existence man’s comfort more
or less depends.</p>

<p>During the millions of years that have rolled by since
the first appearance of life on the earth, who shall count
the number of types which have been exterminated
without leaving the faintest trace of their having ever
existed? The survivors which have contrived to maintain
a place in the sun present an infinite range of
variation in colour, size, habit, and structure, as well as
in emotions. These varied aspects are all so many facets
of the mysterious phenomenon we call Life: and they
are so many witnesses of the versatility of Life. Not
the least mysterious feature of this Life is its faculty
of reproduction, which expresses itself in an infinite
variety of ways, defying all but the crudest forms of
analysis. The evolution of sex has exercised the speculative
ingenuity of some of the acutest students of
Nature from the earliest times, and we are still far from
a satisfactory solution of the problems it presents.
Hermaphroditism and Parthenogenesis are commonly
regarded as degenerate forms of reproduction, but it
would probably be more correct to see in them exceptional
modes of adaptation enabling such individuals to occupy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
niches in the world untenable to creatures of more conservative
habit. That the peculiar “strains” of animal
life have turned into backwaters which offer no opportunity
or possibility of further advancement seems clear
enough, but they are nevertheless interesting and
instructive.</p>

<p>The parthenogenetic Crustacea and the Rotifers afford
some good evidence of this adaptability—of the way
in which creatures manage to cling to the skirts of life
by reason of their power to survive the extremest tests
of endurance. And this success has largely been due
to some mysterious property of the germ-plasm enabling
reproduction to take place through the female line alone,
or in some cases with an occasional fillip from the intervention
of males. Of the many marvellous things that
could be related of these creatures but few instances
can be cited here.</p>

<p>The case of the Brine Shrimp (<i>Artemia salina</i>) will
afford an exceptionally good illustration because the facts
can be tested by anyone who will take the trouble
to make a simple experiment for himself. Those
anxious to do this should dissolve eight ounces of
Tidman’s sea-salt in a glass jar containing five pints of
water, keeping the mixture well stirred till the salt is
dissolved. It should be allowed to stand and be carefully
watched. In about three days, with a pocket-lens, or
even without, minute white specks will be seen moving
with a jerky motion up and down the water. These are
larval Brine Shrimps. Now they must be fed. Take a
piece of lettuce-leaf or any green stuff, and pound it up,
or grind it up with a knife-blade on a plate with a little
water, till the whole is reduced to the consistency of green
paint; then empty this into the water. This must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
done daily, or at any rate frequently. Quickly these tiny
specks will grow into Brine Shrimps, translucent creatures
nearly half an inch long, swimming about back downwards
with a marvellously rhythmical movement of delicate
feet. In all probability no males will be found, but,
on the other hand, both sexes in almost equal numbers
may be present. The males may readily be distinguished
by their massive arms immediately behind the head,
for the purpose of embracing the females.</p>

<p>Whence came these wonderful animals? The mystery
is easily explained. The salt is genuine sea-salt, formed
in brine-pans, chiefly in the Mediterranean. As the
water evaporated the Shrimps it contained gradually
died; but the eggs in the females became encapsuled in
the salt-crystals to hatch out long months after. In one
of my own experiments I succeeded with salt that I had
kept for more than a year. Of course, every sample of
salt experimented with will not yield successful results,
but failures are not expensive. Now in this brine-pan
there were myriads of other animals which were killed
outright: the Brine Shrimp is at least able to pass on
descendants by reason of the vitality of its eggs. Some
near relations of the Brine Shrimps live in fresh water
and possess similar powers of resistance to adverse
conditions. The Fairy Shrimp (<i>Chirocephalus</i>) is one of
these. Not unlike its cousin the Brine Shrimp in appearance,
it lives in shallow pools, such as have muddy
bottoms and are constantly liable to dry up. Birds
hunting by the margins of the pool where the retreating
water has left a fringe of mud bear away more or less of
this on their feet and transport it to similar pools, or even
puddles. Such transplanted samples may easily contain
numbers of eggs of this tiny creature. Only a year or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>two ago Fairy Shrimps were found in abundance in rain
pools at Eton, and some, indeed, were discovered swimming
gaily about in a rain-filled cart-rut!</p>

<p>Another very singular Crustacean, known as <i>Apus</i>,
bears a curious superficial likeness to the King Crab
(<i>Limulus</i>), having a large back-shield and a long tail.
This little creature, a giant compared with his nearest
relations, is an inhabitant of wayside ponds and ditches.
Thousands of females may be taken for years in succession
without the advent of a single male. Then, for
some strange reason which we cannot even guess at,
males appear. Like its freshwater cousin, the Fairy
Shrimp, <i>Apus</i> can withstand drought: its favourite haunts
may be transformed into sun-baked hollows, but with a
heavy fall of rain and a few hours’ soaking the eggs left
by dead females develop, and once more the pool and
its inhabitants are established again. Having regard to
the extraordinary vitality of these small creatures, it is
curious that they should ever disappear from their favoured
haunts. But they do. Not many years ago <i>Apus</i> could
be found in abundance in many parts of the South of
England. It is now extinct; its last resorts were the
ponds at Hampstead: now one may search in vain for
them. “No British specimens,” remarks Dr. Caiman,
a great authority on the Crustacea, “had been recorded
for over forty years, and the species was believed to be
extinct in this country, when it was found in 1907 by
Mr. F. Balfour Browne in a brackish marsh near Southwick,
in Kirkcudbrightshire.” These had probably
developed from eggs accidentally transported by some
bird from the Continent. The extinction of the race
throughout the British Islands can only be attributed
to the too long absence of males, and the consequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
inability to restore vigour by the more normal method
of reproduction by sexual congress.</p>

<p>Among the Rotifers the little Wheel-animalcules
exhibit an even greater vitality, for not only can their eggs
withstand prolonged desiccation, but in some the body of
the animal survives even harsher treatment. If specimens
be enclosed within a chamber containing a little sand or
moss the contents may be dried over sulphuric acid, or
heated up to 200° F., or left to the neglected dust of
years, and will yet revive if a little fresh water be added
to the sand. Males are rare, and when they do occur
are little more than animated receptacles for semen, for
they are incapable of feeding, the gullet and digestive
tract being reduced to a solid cord. A certain amount
of nourishment, however, may be absorbed through the
delicate body wall.</p>

<p>The degeneration of the males in these parthenogenetic
species irresistibly reminds one of the smile of the Cheshire
cat; they grow smaller and smaller, and their functions
less and less, till finally nothing is left. The “complemental
males” discovered years ago by Darwin in the
Barnacles well illustrate this process. In dissecting adult
specimens of the stalked Barnacle (<i>Scalpellum</i>) he found,
just inside the valves, in a pocket of the mantle, a varying
number of “complemental males,” tiny organisms which
Mr. Geoffrey Smith describes as “little more than bags
of spermatozoa,” and they apparently serve to fertilize
the ripe ova of the larger animal—one cannot say of the
female, for Scalpellum, like most of the Barnacles, is
hermaphrodite. But it is believed that these complemental
males are really arrested hermaphrodites. At
any rate, if it so be noted that with some of the Barnacles,
as with some other Crustacea, the larvæ are males, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>when adult life is attained female glands appear and
hermaphroditism is established. Such hermaphrodites
have the singular distinction of being males which have
acquired female attributes, true females being unknown
among them!</p>

<p>In one of the parasitic Crustacea (<i>Chondracanthus</i>)
infesting the gills of Gurnard, Plaice, Skate and other
fish, the adult female is about half an inch long, and
very unlike a Crustacean in appearance; the male is
an extremely minute maggot-like object—a few millimetres
in length—and lives permanently attached to
the belly of his mate just at the base of the egg masses.
More remarkable still is the case of another nearly related
parasitic species—<i>Lernea</i>—which becomes sexually mature
in its childhood. The males perform their part and die;
their mates arrive at maturity and settle down to a
comfortable life as parasites on fish, reproducing without
further mating.</p>

<p>That Parthenogenesis and Hermaphroditism are but
specialized forms of reproduction, leading sooner or later
to degeneration and extinction, there can be no doubt.
They are, so to speak, failures in the evolution of sex,
demonstrating in a very forcible fashion the impossibility
of progress—as we understand it—where the sexual
functions are thus combined.</p>

<p>To the differentiation of sex, resulting in separate male
and female individuals, we must attribute the marvellous
complexity of the pageant of life which confronts us
to-day. The story of the Courtship of Animals is only
one of an infinite number of incidents in this pageant,
and one which is by no means easy of interpretation.</p>

<p>In these pages an attempt has been made to show that
this differentiation of sex has, throughout, been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span> accompanied
by, and largely moulded by, common instincts
and behaviour, and this interpretation is only to be
reached by a study of the phenomena in their simplest
form among the lower grades of animal life. Colour and
the various sexual differences in form have been allowed
to dominate this investigation of the problem of sex, and
have diverted attention from more profitable and fruitful
channels.</p>

<p>The lower we descend in the scale of animal life the
less convincing becomes the argument that the colour,
ornament or armature of the males is the result of sexual
selection in the older, Darwinian sense. The argument
of Geddes and Thomson and others that the males are
more “katabolic,” the females more “anabolic,” seems
no less unsatisfactory, for in many cases the female is
just as highly ornamented as the male, and in others
she is considerably large. Further, in their less specialized
species the sexes are almost or quite indistinguishable
externally, and are sombrely clad, just as at the opposite
extreme we find them equally ornamented and equally
active.</p>

<p>We shall be nearer the truth if we regard these
secondary sexual characters as expression points of
germinal variations. Though we seem hopelessly ignorant
as to the inciting cause of the variations, at least we
seem to be able to lay a finger on the agents by which
they are effected. And these are the hormones of the
primary and secondary sexual glands, whose functions
affect more than the merely sexual side of the organism.
They profoundly affect the coloration of animals, giving
rise on the one hand to purely ornamental “secondary
sexual characters,” and on the other to changes of coloration
which achieve the ends of protective resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
colours, or of “warning coloration,” as circumstances
may demand. There is nothing more remarkable in
this than the control which the pituitary body exercises
over stature, either when in a pathological condition,
or when the controlling action of the other gland secretions
is removed, as by castration.</p>

<p>Hitherto much has been made of trophic nerves, which
control growth; but it is probable we have overlooked
the still more important action of “trophic” glands,
such as the thyroid. This apparently controls growth
in many directions. Adaptations to environment which
are effected by changes in bodily shape-as in the transformation
of land-dwelling mammals into Seals and
Whales—are probably largely controlled by these glands.
Their activity is as great as their manifestation is varied.</p>

<p>Why their action should be more stimulating in the
case of the male, why he should lead the way in all the
new acquirements of the species, both in non-sexual as
well as in sexual characters, is by no means plain. But
the fact remains that this is so. Remove any one of these
glands and the machinery of growth is thrown out of
gear; it is not merely the secondary sexual characters
which are affected.</p>

<p>But these glands are concerned no less intimately with
the behaviour of animals. This is most obvious in all
that concerns sexual appetite as the preceding chapters
have already shown. Having regard to the immense
variety of animals concerned, this behaviour presents an
underlying uniformity of expression which must not be
lost sight of: and the same is no less true of what we may
call the physical manifestations of these glandular activities.</p>
